<h5>IN WHICH REFERENCE IS MADE TO A STRANGE, UNFATHOMABLE BEING THROUGH WHOSE
INSTRUMENTALITY AN AWFUL MYSTERY WAS SOLVED.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The manner in which I became intimately associated with a
fearful mystery with which not only all London but all England was ringing, and
the strange, inexplicable Being whom the course of events brought to my
knowledge, are so startling and wonderful, that I have grown to believe that by
no effort of the imagination, however wild and bewildering the labyrinths into
which it may lead a man, can the actual realism of our everyday life be
outrivalled. What I am about to narrate is absolutely true--somewhat of an
unnecessary statement, for the reason that human fancy could never have invented
it. To a person unfamiliar with the wondrous life of a great city like London
the story may appear impossible, but there are thousands of men and women who
will immediately recognise in it features with which they became acquainted
through the columns of the newspapers. I venture to say that the leading
incident by which one morning--it was but yesterday--the great city was thrilled
and horrified can never be entirely effaced from their memories. Dark crimes and
deeds of heroism, in which the incidents are pathetic or pitiful, draw even
strangers into sympathetic relation with each other. These events come home to
us, as it were. What happened to one whose face we have never seen, whose hand
we have never grasped, may happen to us who move in the same familiar grooves of
humanity. Our hopes and fears, our joys and sorrows, our duties and temptations,
are the same, because we are human; and it is this common tie of kinship that
will cause the story of Devlin the Barber to be received with more than ordinary
interest. Now, for the first time is revealed, in these pages, the strange
manner in which the fearful mystery in which it was enshrouded was unravelled.
The facts are as I shall relate them, and whatever the impression they may
create, a shuddering curiosity must inevitably be aroused as to the nature and
movements of the inscrutable Being through whose instrumentality I was made the
agent in revealing what would otherwise have remained for ever hidden from human
knowledge. By a few incredulous persons--I refer to those to whom nothing
spiritual is demonstrable--the existence of this Being may be doubted; but none
the less does he live and move among us this very day, pursuing his mission with
a purpose and to an end which it is not in the power of mortal insight to
fathom. It is not unlikely that some of my readers may have come unconsciously
in contact with him within the last few hours.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_01" href="#div1Ref_01">CHAPTER I.</a></h4>

<h5>IN WHICH AN ACCOUNT IS GIVEN OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH BEFELL MR. MELLADEW.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">I am a struggling man--the phrase will be well understood, for
the class to which I belong is a large one--and I reside in a neighbourhood
which is neither very poor nor very fashionable. I have, of course, my friends
and acquaintances, and among the most intimate of the former is a family of the
name of Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Melladew is a reader in a printing-office in which a
weekly newspaper is printed. Mrs. Melladew, with the assistance of one small
servant, manages the home. They had two daughters, twins, eighteen years of age,
named respectively Mary and Elizabeth. These girls were very beautiful, and were
so much alike that they were frequently mistaken for one another. Mrs. Melladew
has told me that when they were very young she was compelled to make some
distinguishing mark in their dress to avoid confusion in her recognition of
them, such as differently coloured socks or pieces of ribbon. The home of the
Melladews was a happy one, and the sisters loved each other sincerely. They were
both in outdoor employment, in the establishments of a general linendraper and a
fashionable dressmaker. Mary was in the employment of the
linendraper--Limbird's, in Regent Street. It is a firm of wide repute, and
employs a great number of hands, some of whom sleep in the house. This was the
case with Mary Melladew, who went to her work on Monday morning and did not
return home until Saturday night. Elizabeth, or Lizzie as she was always called,
was employed by Madame Michel, in Baker Street. She went to her work at
half-past eight every morning and returned home at half-past seven every night.</p>

<p class="normal">The printing-office in which Mr. Melladew is engaged employs
two readers, a night reader and a day reader. Mr. Melladew is the day reader,
his hours being from nine in the morning till seven in the evening. But on
Saturdays he has a much longer spell; he is due in the office at eight in the
morning, and he remains until two or three hours past midnight--a stretch of
eighteen or nineteen hours. By that time all the work for the Sunday edition of
the weekly newspaper is done, and the outside pages are being worked off on the
steam presses.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, upon the Saturday morning on which, so far as I am
concerned, the enthralling interest of my story commences, certain important
events had occurred in my career and in that of Mr. Melladew. Exactly one month
previous to that day, the firm in which I had been employed for a great many
years had given me a month's notice to leave. My dismissal was not caused by any
lapse of duty on my part; it was simply that business had been for some time in
a bad state, and that my employers found it necessary to reduce their staff.
Among those who received notice to quit, I, unfortunately, was included.
Therefore, when I rose on Saturday morning I was in the dismal position of a man
out of work, my time having expired on the day before. This was of serious
importance to me. With Mr. Melladew the case was different. In what unexpectedly
occurred to him there was bright sunshine, to be succeeded by black darkness.</p>

<p class="normal">He had visited me on the Friday night, and I perceived at once
that he was in a state of intense and pleasurable excitement.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have come to tell you some good news,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment I thought that this good news might affect
myself, and might bring about a favourable turn in my affairs, but Mr.
Melladew's next words dispelled the hope.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am the happiest man in London,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">I reflected gravely, but not enviously, upon my own position,
and waited for Mr. Melladew to explain himself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did I ever mention to you,&quot; he asked, &quot;that I had a
brother-in-law in Australia?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;you have spoken of him lately two or three
times.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So many years had passed,&quot; said Mr. Melladew, &quot;since my wife
heard from him that I had almost forgotten him. He is her brother, you know, and
his name is Portland--Richard Portland. That was my wife's name before we were
married---not Richard, of course, but Portland.&quot; He laughed, and rubbed his leg
with his right hand; in his left hand was a letter. &quot;It was about eight months
ago that we received a letter from him, asking us to give him information about
our family and circumstances. He did not say anything about his own, so we were
left quite in the dark as to whether he was rich or poor, or a married man or a
bachelor. However, my wife answered his letter, and sent him the pictures of our
two girls, and in her letter she asked whether he was married and had a family,
and said also that she would like him to send us their pictures. Well, we heard
nothing further from him till to-day. Another letter came from him while I was
at the office. You may read it; there is nothing private in it. It isn't from
Australia; it is written from Southampton, you see. But that is not the only
surprise in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I took the letter and read it. It was, indeed, a letter to
give pleasurable surprise to the receiver. Without any announcement to Mr.
Melladew of his intention, Mr. Portland had left Australia, and was now in
Southampton. He intended to start by an early train on Saturday morning for
London, and would come straight to his brother-in-law's house. In the letter he
replied to the questions put by Mrs. Melladew. He was a bachelor, without family
ties of any kind in Australia. Moreover, he had made his fortune, and it was the
portraits of his two nieces which were the main cause of his return to England.
Their beauty had evidently made a deep impression upon him. He spoke of them and
of Mrs. Melladew in the most affectionate terms, and said it was a great
pleasure to him to think that he was coming to a home which he hoped he might
look upon as partly his own. He sent his warmest love to them all, and in
pleasantly tender words, the meaning of which could scarcely be mistaken, he
desired a message to be given to his &quot;dear nieces,&quot; to the effect that &quot;their
ship had come home.&quot; I handed the letter back to Mr. Melladew, and expressed my
gratification at the good news.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is good news,&quot; he said gleefully, &quot;the best of news. I
knew you would be pleased. I am wondering whether it is a large or a small
fortune he has made. My wife says a large one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And <i>I</i> say a large one,&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What makes you of that opinion?&quot; inquired Mr. Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, in the first place there are so many large fortunes
made in Australia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then, money being so much more plentiful there than here, a
man gets to think less of a little than we do. His ideas become larger, I mean.
At any time these last dozen years a hundred pounds would have been a God-send
to me, and I should have thought of it so----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So would I,&quot; interposed Mr. Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But if you and I were in a land of gold, we should, I
daresay, think much more lightly of a hundred pounds. I wish I had emigrated
when I was first married; I had the chance, and let it slip. But it's no use
crying over spilt milk.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not a bit of use,&quot; said Mr. Melladew; &quot;life's a perpetual
grind here, and I am truly grateful for the light this letter has let in upon
us. You've given me two reasons for thinking my brother-in-law's fortune a large
one. Have you any others?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, he speaks of your daughters' ship having come home.
That looks as if he meant to provide for them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It <i>does</i> look like it,&quot; said Mr. Melladew; and I saw
that my arguments had given him pleasure. &quot;My wife has a reason, also, for
thinking so. She says, when Dick--that is her brother, you know--went away he
declared he would never come back to England unless he could come back a very
rich man. 'And,' says my wife, 'what Dick said, he'd stick to.' She is sure of
that. It's wonderful, isn't it? He didn't have a sovereign to bless himself with
when he left England, and now--but it's no use speculating. We shall know
everything soon. You will understand my feelings; you have children of your
own.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I had indeed, and it made me rueful to think of them. Getting
another situation in such hard times was no easy matter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It isn't for myself,&quot; resumed Mr. Melladew, &quot;that I am
overjoyed at the better prospect before us: it is for my girls. Perhaps it means
that they will not have to go out to work any longer. They are good girls, but
they are so pretty, and have such engaging ways, that I have often been
disturbed by the circumstance of their not being so much under my own and their
mother's eyes as we would wish them to be. It could not be helped hitherto.
There's the question of dress, now. You can manage tolerably well when they're
little girls; a clever woman like my wife can turn and twist, and cut up old
things in a way to make the little ones look quite nice; but when they become
young women, with all sorts of new ideas in their pretty heads, it is another
pair of shoes. It's natural, too, that they should want a little pocket money to
spend upon innocent pleasures and harmless vanities. We were young ourselves
once, weren't we? We found we couldn't afford to give the girls what they
wanted. They saw it, too, so they made up their minds, without saying a word to
us, to look out for situations for themselves, and for months they haven't been
a farthing's expense to us. They even give their mother a trifle a week towards
the home. Good girls, the best of girls; I should be a miserable man without
them. Still, as I said, I have been uneasy about them: there are so many
scoundrels in the world ready with honeyed words to turn a girl's head; and it
hurts me to think that they have their little secrets which they don't ask us to
share. Now, thank God, it will be all right. My brother-in-law will be here
to-morrow, and when he sees Lizzie and Mary he will be confirmed in his kind
intentions towards them. They can leave their situations; and if any man wishes
to pay them attentions he can do so in a straightforward manner in the home in
which they were brought up.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was in the blithest of spirits, and I cordially renewed my
congratulations on his good fortune. In return, he condoled with me on the
unpromising change in my own prospects. I was not very cheerful--no man could be
in such a position--but I am not in the habit of magnifying my misfortunes to my
friends, and I plucked up my spirits.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will soon get another situation,&quot; said Mr. Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope so,&quot; I replied; &quot;I cannot afford to keep long out of
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may be in my power to give you a lift,&quot; he said kindly.
&quot;Who knows what may turn up in the course of the next few hours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I attached no signification to this not uncommon remark at the
time it was uttered, but it recurred to me afterwards, charged with sad and
terrible import. We fell to again discussing the matter of which he was full.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am almost ashamed of my good luck,&quot; said Mr. Melladew,
&quot;when I think what has happened to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A man must accept the ups and downs of life with courage,&quot; I
said, &quot;and must put the best face he can upon them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">We were true friends, and I had a sincere respect for him as a
worthy fellow who had faithfully performed his duties to his family and
employers. He was passionately fond of his two daughters, and frequently spoke
of them as the greatest blessing in his life. It was, indeed, delightful to
witness the affection he bestowed upon them in the happy home of which he was
the head. They were girls of which any man might have been proud, being not only
beautiful, but bright and witty, and full of animation.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Melladew and I chatted together for another half-hour, and
then he wished me good-night.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is fortunate,&quot; he said, &quot;that I got away from the office
an hour earlier than usual. I shall be at home when Lizzie returns from her
work, and I want to be the first to tell her the good news. How excited she will
be! There was a friend at the house last night, who told us our fortunes. Lizzie
is very fond of having her fortune told. 'There, father,' she says, 'didn't my
fortune say that I was to receive a letter? And I've got one.' As if there was
anything out of the way in receiving a letter! Last night she was told that a
great and wonderful surprise was in store for her. Well, there is, but I am
certain the fortune-teller knew as much about its nature as the man in the
moon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And Mary?&quot; I said. &quot;Will you tell her to-night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. Melladew, &quot;we will wait till she comes home
to-morrow. When she sees her uncle from Australia sitting in my arm-chair, she
won't know what to think of it. Happy girls, happy girls!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And happy father and mother, too,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, yes,&quot; he said, with great feeling, &quot;and happy father and
mother too.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was in no envious spirit that I contrasted his good luck
with my bad, but had I suspected what the next few hours had in store for him, I
should have thanked God for my lot. We have reason to be profoundly grateful for
the ills we escape.</p>

<h4><a name="div1_02" href="#div1Ref_02">CHAPTER II.</a></h4>

<h5>I AM THE RECIPIENT OF TERRIBLE NEWS.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">On Saturday morning I rose early, with the strange feelings of
a man whose habits of life had been suddenly and violently wrenched out of their
usual course. I wandered up and down the stairs and into all the rooms in the
house, and to the street-door, where I stood looking vacantly along the street,
perhaps for the situation I had lost, as though it were something I had dropped
by accident and could pick up again. Two or three neighbours passed and gave me
good-morning, and one paused and asked if I was not well.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not well?&quot; I echoed, somewhat irritably; &quot;I am well, quite
well. What makes you think otherwise?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O,&quot; he answered apologetically, &quot;only seeing you here, that's
all. It's so unusual.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He passed on, looking once or twice behind him. Unusual? Of
course it was unusual. Everything was unusual, everything in the world, which
seemed to be turned topsy-turvy. If the people in the street had walked on their
heads instead of their feet it would not have surprised me very much. I should
have regarded it as quite in keeping with the fact that I was standing at my own
street-door in idleness at half-past eight o'clock on a Saturday morning; I
could not remember the time when such a thing had occurred to me.</p>

<p class="normal">Standing thus in a state of semi-stupefaction, the postman
came up and gave me a letter. This recalled me to myself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now,&quot; thought I, as I turned the envelope over in my hand,
&quot;whom is it from, and what does it contain?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At first I had an unreasonable hope that it was from my
employers, imploring me to come back, but a glance at the address convinced me
that it was a foolish hope. The writing was strange to me, and the envelope was
a common one, and was fastened with sealing-wax bearing the impression of a
thimble. I opened and read the letter, and although it did not contain the offer
of a situation, or hold out the prospect of one, the contents interested me. I
shall have occasion presently to refer to this letter more particularly, and
shall at present content myself with saying that had it not arrived this story
would never have been written. While my wife and I were at breakfast we spoke of
it, and I said it was my intention to comply with the request it contained.</p>

<p class="normal">Over breakfast, also, we reviewed our position. During my
years of employment I had managed to save very little money, and upon reckoning
up what I had in my purse and what I owed, I arrived at a balance in my favour
of a little less than four pounds, which represented the whole of my worldly
wealth. A poor look-out, and I was reflecting upon it gloomily, when my good
little wife, with a tender deprecatory smile, laid before me on the table a Post
Office savings-book.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is this?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Look,&quot; she replied.</p>

<p class="normal">The book was made out in her name, and the small deposits,
extending over a number of years, made therein showed a credit of more than
twenty pounds.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yours?&quot; I said, in wonder. &quot;Really yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said my wife. &quot;Yours.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">My heart beat with joy; these twenty pounds were like a
reprieve. I should have time to look about, without being tortured by fears of
immediate want. I drew my wife to my side, and embraced her. Twenty pounds, with
which to commence over again the battle of life! Why it was a fortune! How the
little woman had contrived to save so much out of her scanty housekeeping money
was a mystery to me, but she had done it by hook or by crook, as the saying is,
and she now experienced a true and sweet delight in handing it over to me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well,&quot; said I, rubbing my hands cheerfully, &quot;things might
look worse than they do--a great deal worse. We have a little store to help us
over compulsorily idle days, and, thank God, all the children are well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was much to be grateful for, and we kissed each other in
token of our gratitude, and also as a pledge that we would not lose heart, but
would battle bravely on.</p>

<p class="normal">I had just finished my second cup of tea when the street-door
was hastily opened, and my friend Mr. Melladew staggered, or rather fell, into
the room, with a face as white as a ghost. His limbs were trembling so that he
could not stand, and my wife, much alarmed, started up and helped him into a
chair.</p>

<p class="normal">On this special morning we had breakfasted late, and as my
wife was assisting Mr. Melladew the clock struck ten.</p>

<p class="normal">It sometimes happens that the most ordinary occurrences become
of unusual importance by reason of circumstances with which they have no
connection. Thus it was that the striking of ten o'clock, as I gazed upon the
white face of my visitor, filled me with an apprehension of impending evil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good God!&quot; I cried. &quot;What has happened?&quot; My thought was that
there had been an accident to the train by which Mr. Melladew expected his
brother-in-law from Southampton, but I was soon undeceived. It was difficult to
extract anything intelligible from Mr. Melladew in his terrible state of
agitation; but eventually I was placed in possession of the following
particulars.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Melladew had risen early and had left his wife abed, and,
as he supposed, his daughter Lizzie. It was Mrs. Melladew's custom on Saturday
mornings to take half-an-hour extra in the way of sleep, and Mr. Melladew would
prepare his own breakfast on these occasions. He did so on this morning, and
left his house at twenty minutes to eight. At eight o'clock punctually he was
sitting at his desk in the printing-office, reading proofs. Everything was going
on as usual, the only pleasant difference being the extraordinary lightness of
Mr. Melladew's heart as he thought of his rich brother-in-law from Australia,
perhaps at that very hour stepping into the train for London, and of his two
darling children, Lizzie and Mary. He did not, however, allow this contemplation
to interfere with the faithful and steady discharge of his duties, and his work
proceeded uninterruptedly until half-past nine, when he sent his young
assistant, a reading boy, into the composing-room with the last proofs he had
read, telling him to bring back any more that were ready. A workman at the
galley-press had just pulled off a column of newly set-up matter, and the lad,
without waiting for it to be delivered to him, took the slip from the printer's
hand, and returned quickly to the reading-room. Mr. Melladew, receiving the slip
from his assistant, was about to commence arranging the &quot;copy,&quot; which the lad
had also brought with him, when a compositor rushed in, and, snatching both slip
and &quot;copy&quot; from Mr. Melladew's desk, hurriedly left the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What's that for?&quot; inquired Mr. Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know, sir,&quot; replied the lad; &quot;but there's something
'up' in the composing-room. The men are all standing talking in a regular
fluster.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What about?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ain't got a notion, sir; but they seem regular upset.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Curious to ascertain what was going on, Mr. Melladew strolled
into the composing-room, and was struck by the sudden silence which ensued upon
his entrance. It was all the more singular because Mr. Melladew, as he pushed
the door open, heard the men speaking in excited voices, and had half a fancy
that he heard his own name uttered in tones of pity. &quot;Poor Melladew!&quot; Yes, it
was not a fancy. The words had been uttered at the moment of his entrance. The
silence of the compositors, their pitying looks, confirmed it. But why should
they speak of him as &quot;poor Melladew&quot; at a time when life had never been so
bright and fair? What was the meaning of the pitying glances directed towards
him? The composing-room, especially on Saturdays, was a scene of lively bustle
and animation, but now the men were standing idle, stick in hand, at the corners
of their frames, or tip-toeing over their cases, and the eyes of every man there
were fixed upon Mr. Melladew. Had he been in trouble, had his wife or one of his
darling daughters been ill, his thoughts would have immediately flown to his
home, and he would have seen in the pitying glances of the compositors a sign of
some dread misfortune; but in his happy mood he received no such impression.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What on earth is the matter with you all?&quot; he said in a light
tone.</p>

<p class="normal">He saw the compositor who had snatched the slip of new matter
from his desk, and before he could be prevented he took it from the man's hand.</p>

<p class="normal">The compositors found their voices.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Mr. Melladew!&quot; they cried. &quot;No; don't, don't!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nonsense!&quot; he said, and keeping possession of the slip, he
left the composing-room for his own.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go and get the copy,&quot; he said to the lad who had followed
him.</p>

<p class="normal">When the lad was gone he spread the slip on the desk before
him. The first words he saw formed the title of the column he was about to read:
&quot;Horrible Murder in Victoria Park!&quot; Beneath it were the sub-headings, &quot;Stabbed
to the Heart!&quot; and &quot;A Bunch of Blood-stained Daisies!&quot; To a newspaper reader
such events, shocking though they be, are unhappily no novelties, and Mr.
Melladew looked down the column, I will not say mechanically, for he was a
humane man, but steadily, and stirred no doubt by pity and indignation. But
before he had got half-way down the pulsations of his heart seemed to stop, and
the words swam before his eyes. His eyes lighted on the name of the girl who had
been murdered.</p>

<p class="normal">It was that of his own daughter, Lizzie Melladew!</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>A SHOAL OF VISITORS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER MYSTERY.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">In an agony of horror and despair he had flown from the
printing-office to my house.</p>

<p class="normal">I cannot say whether he chose my house premeditatedly; it is
likely that it was done without distinct intention, but it was a proof that he
regarded my friendship as genuine, and that he knew he could depend upon my
sympathy in times of trouble. As indeed he could. My heart bled as I gazed upon
him. The words issued with difficulty from his trembling lips; his features were
convulsed; he shook like a man in an ague.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, my Lizzie!&quot; he moaned. &quot;My poor, poor Lizzie! O, my child,
my child!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I took in regularly a penny daily newspaper, and I had read it
on this morning, but there was no mention in its columns of the dreadful
occurrence. The discovery had been made too late for the first editions of the
daily journals.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Melladew's story being told, disjointedly, and in
fragments which I had to piece together in order to arrive at an intelligible
comprehension of it, the unhappy man sat before me, moaning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, my Lizzie! O, my poor child!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was she at home?&quot; I asked gently; I did not attempt to
console him. Of what avail were mere words at such a moment? &quot;Was she at home
when you went from here last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, she was there,&quot; he moaned. &quot;When she went to bed I
kissed her. For the last time! For the last, last time!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">And then he broke down utterly. I could get nothing further
from him.</p>

<p class="normal">When she went to bed, he kissed her. What kind of riddle was
here, in the midst of the horrible tragedy, that the hapless girl should have
wished her parents good-night and retired to rest, and be found ruthlessly
murdered a few hours afterwards in an open park at some distance from her house?
With such joyful news as Mr. Melladew had to communicate to his daughter, the
probability was that they had kept up later than usual, talking of the brighter
future that then seemed spread before them. It made the tragic riddle all the
more difficult.</p>

<p class="normal">There came a knock at the street-door, and a gentleman was
admitted, upon most urgent business he said. It turned out that he was a
newspaper reporter, who, in advance of the police, had tracked Mr. Melladew to
my house, and had come to obtain information from him for his newspaper. I
pointed out to him the condition of Mr. Melladew, and said something to the
effect that it was scarcely decent to intrude upon him at such a time.</p>

<p class="normal">The reporter, who evidently felt deeply for the bereaved
father, and whose considerate manner was such as to completely disarm me, said
aside to me,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pray do not think that I am devoid of feeling; I am a father
myself, and have a daughter of the age of his poor girl. My mission is not one
of idle curiosity. A ruthless murder has been committed, and the murderer is at
large. I am not working only for my paper; I am assisting the cause of justice.
Every scrap of information we can obtain will hasten the arrest of the wretch
who has been guilty of a crime so diabolical.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He can tell you nothing,&quot; I said, compelled to admit that he
was right. &quot;Look at him as he sits there, crushed and broken down by the blow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I pity him from my heart,&quot; said the reporter. &quot;Can you assist
me in any way? Did the poor girl live at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She lived at home certainly, but she had employment at Madame
Michel's, in Baker Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Madame Michel's, in Baker Street. I must go there. Did she
sleep out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; she came home every night at half-past seven.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did she do so last night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did she not go to some place of amusement?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not to my knowledge. Her father told me that before she went
to bed he kissed her good-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know at what hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But presumably not early.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not so early as usual, I should say, because her father had
some good news to communicate to her, and they would stop up late talking of it.
Understand, much of what I say is presumptive.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But reasonable,&quot; said the reporter. &quot;Did the poor girl have a
sweetheart?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Words which Mr. Melladew had spoken on the previous night
recurred to me here. &quot;There are so many scoundrels in the world ready with
honeyed words to turn a girl's head; and it hurts me to think that they have
their little secrets which they don't ask us to share.&quot; Did not this point to a
secret which was hidden from her parents? I said nothing of this to the
reporter, but answered that I was not aware that the poor girl had a sweetheart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Some one must have been in love with her,&quot; said the reporter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Many, perhaps,&quot; I rejoined; &quot;but not one courted her openly,
I believe--that is, to her parents' knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That counts for very little. She was a beautiful girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How?&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;Have you seen her?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saw her this morning,&quot; he answered gravely, &quot;within the
last two hours. She looked like an angel.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was there no trace of suffering in her face?&quot; I asked
wistfully.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. She was stabbed to the heart--only one, sharp, swift,
devilish blow, and death must have been instantaneous. To my unprofessional eye
it almost seems as if she must have died in sleep--in happy sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That, at least, is merciful. Hush!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Melladew was rocking to and fro murmuring, &quot;O, my Lizzie,
my darling child! O, my poor, poor Lizzie!&quot; We had spoken in low tones, and he
evinced no consciousness of having heard what we said. During our conversation
the reporter was jotting down notes unobtrusively. The conversation would
doubtless have been continued had it not been for the appearance of other
persons, following rapidly upon each other, policemen, and additional reporters,
who had discovered that Mr. Melladew was in my house. The last to appear was
Mrs. Melladew, who had heard rumours of the frightful crime, and who flew round
to me, not knowing that her husband was in the room. What passed from that
moment, while all these persons were buzzing around me, was so confusing that I
cannot hope to give an intelligible transcript of it. I was, as it were, in the
background, as one who had no immediate interest in the unravelling of the
terrible mystery. It was a most agitating time to me and my wife, and when my
visitors had all departed I felt like a man who had been afflicted by a horrible
nightmare. How little did I imagine that the letter I had received by the early
morning's post, and which I had in my pocket, was vitally connected with it, and
that of all those present I was the man who was destined to bring the mystery to
light!</p>

<p class="normal">Before the day was over fresh surprises were in store for me
in connection with the dreadful deed. Needless to say that the whole
neighbourhood was in a state of great excitement; so numerous were my idle
visitors that I was compelled to tell my wife to admit into the house no person
but the Melladews, or relatives of theirs. In the afternoon, however, one
visitor called who would not be denied. He sent in his card, which bore the name
of George Carton, and I said I would see him.</p>

<p class="normal">He was a young man, whose age I judged to be between twenty
and twenty-five, well dressed, and remarkably good-looking. His manners were
those of one who was accustomed to move in good society, and both his speech and
behaviour during the interview impressed me favourably. I observed when he
entered the room that he was greatly agitated.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have intruded myself upon you, sir,&quot; he said, &quot;because I
felt that I should go mad if I did not speak to some person who was a friend
of--or----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He could not proceed, and I finished the sentence for him. &quot;Of
the poor girl who has been so cruelly murdered?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He nodded his head, and, when he could control his voice,
said, &quot;You were an intimate friend of hers, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Melladew's family and mine,&quot; I replied, &quot;have been on
terms of friendship for many years. I have known the poor girl and her sister
since their infancy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not dare to call upon Mr. Melladew,&quot; he said, and then
he faltered again and paused.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you acquainted with him?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; he said, &quot;but I hoped to be. If I went now and told him
what I wish to impart to you, he might look upon me as responsible for what has
occurred.&quot; He put his hand over his eyes, from which the tears were flowing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it you wish to impart to me?&quot; I inquired, &quot;and why
should you suppose you would be held responsible for so horrible a crime?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I scarcely know what I am saying,&quot; he replied. &quot;But my secret
intimacy with Lizzie&quot;--I caught my breath at his familiar utterance of the
name--&quot;becoming known to him now for the first time, might put wrong ideas into
his head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your secret intimacy with Lizzie?&quot; I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We have known each other for more than four months,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Secretly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, secretly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And the poor girl's parents were not aware of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They were not. It was partly my poor Lizzie's wish, and
partly my own, I think, until I was sure that I possessed her love. She kept it
from me for a long time. 'Wait,' she used to say, smiling--pardon me, sir; my
heart seems as if it would break when I speak of her--'Wait,' she used to say,
'I am not certain yet whether I really, really love you.' But she did, sir, all
along.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; I asked, in doubt now whether I should
regard him with favour or suspicion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She confessed it to me last Tuesday night as she walked home
from Baker Street.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were in the habit of meeting her, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. I beg you to believe, sir, there was nothing wrong in
it. I loved and honoured her sincerely. I wanted then to accompany her home and
ask her parents' permission to pay my addresses to her openly: but she said no,
and that she would speak to them first herself. It was arranged so. She was to
tell them to-night, and I was to call and see her father and mother to-morrow.
And now--and now--&quot; Again he paused, overpowered by grief. Presently he spoke
again. &quot;See here, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He detached a locket from his chain, and opening it, showed me
the sweet and beautiful face of Lizzie Melladew.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was taken for me,&quot; he said, &quot;on Wednesday morning. She
obtained permission from her employers for an hour's absence, and we went
together to get it taken. The photographer hurried the picture on for me, I was
so anxious for it. I had my picture taken for her, and put into a locket, which
I was to give her to-morrow with this ring in the presence of her parents.&quot; He
produced both the locket and the ring. The locket was a handsome gold ornament,
set with pearls; the ring was a half-hoop, set with diamonds. The gifts were
such as only a man in a good position could afford to give. &quot;I shall never be
happy again,&quot; he said mournfully, as he replaced the locket on his chain, after
gazing on the beautiful face with eyes of pitiful love.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were you in the habit of writing to her?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir. No letters passed between us; there was no need to
write, I saw her so often--four or five times a week. 'When father and mother
know everything,' she said on Tuesday night, 'you shall write to me every day.'
I promised that I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am not sorry you confided in me,&quot; I said, completely won
over by the young man's ingenuousness and undoubted sincerity; &quot;but I can offer
you no words of comfort. You will have to make this known to others.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall do what is right, sir. It is not in your power, nor
in any man's, to give me any comfort or consolation. The happiness of my life is
destroyed--but there is still one thing left me, and I will not rest till it is
accomplished. As God is my judge, I will not!&quot; He did not give me time to ask
his meaning, but continued: &quot;You can do me the greatest favour, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must see Mary--her sister, sir. Can you send round to the
house, and ask her to come and see me here? She <i>will</i> come when she gets
my message. Will you do this for me, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;there is no harm in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I called my wife, and bade her go to Mr. Melladew's house, and
contrive to see Mary Melladew privately, and give her the young man's message.
During my wife's absence George Carton and I exchanged but few words. He sat for
the chief part of the time with his head resting on his hand, and I was busy
thinking whether the information he had imparted to me would be likely to afford
a clue to the discovery of the murderer. My wife returned with consternation
depicted on her face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mary is not at home,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where has she gone?&quot; cried George Carton, starting up.</p>

<p class="normal">To my astonishment my wife replied, &quot;They are in the greatest
trouble about her. She has not been home all the day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have they not seen anything of her?&quot; I asked, also rising to
my feet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said my wife, &quot;they have seen nothing whatever of her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it possible,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;that she can be still at her
place of business, in ignorance of what has taken place?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; cried George Carton, in great excitement, &quot;she is not
there. I have been to inquire. She went out last night, and never returned.
Great God! What can be the meaning of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I strove in vain to calm him. He paced the room with flashing
eyes, muttering to himself words so wild that I could not arrive at the least
understanding of them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Gone! Gone!&quot; he cried at last. &quot;But where, where? I will not
sleep, I will not rest, till I find her! Neither will I rest till I discover the
murderer of my darling girl! And when I discover him, when he stands before me,
as there is a living God, I will kill him with my own hands!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His passion was so intense that I feared he would there and
then commit some act of violence, and I made an endeavour to restrain and calm
him by throwing my arms around him; but he broke from me with a torrent of
frantic words, and rushed out of the house.</p>

<p class="normal">Here was another mystery, added to the tragedy of the last few
hours. What was to be the outcome of it? From what quarter was light to come?</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_04" href="#div1Ref_04">CHAPTER IV.</a></h4>

<h5>MR. RICHARD PORTLAND MAKES A SINGULAR PROPOSITION TO ME.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">In the evening I received another visitor, in the person of
Mr. Richard Portland, Mr. Melladew's brother-in-law. A shrewd, hard-headed man,
but much cast down at present. It was clear to me, after a little conversation
with him, that his nieces, Mary and the hapless Lizzie, had been the great
inducement of his coming home to England, and I learnt from him that there was
no doubt about the news of Mary Melladew's mysterious disappearance.</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Portland was a thoroughly practical man, even in matters
of sentiment. It was sentiment truly that had brought him home, but his
expectations had been blasted by the news of the tragedy which had greeted him
on his arrival. He was deeply moved by the affliction which had fallen upon his
sister's family; his indignation was aroused against the monster who had brought
this fearful blow upon them; and, in addition, he was bitterly angry at being
deprived of the society of two lovely, interesting girls, in whose hearts he had
naturally hoped to find a place.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My brother is fit for nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;He is prostrate,
and cannot be roused to action. He moans and moans, and clasps his head. My
sister is no better; she goes out of one fainting fit into another.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What can they do?&quot; I asked. &quot;What would you have them do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not sit idly down,&quot; he replied curtly. &quot;That is not the way
to discover the murderer; and discovered he must and shall be, if it costs me my
fortune.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There have been murders,&quot; I remarked, &quot;in the very heart of
London, and though years have passed, the murderers still walk the streets
undetected.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is incredible,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is true,&quot; was my rejoinder.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But surely,&quot; he urged, &quot;this will not be classed among them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I trust not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Money will do much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Much, but not everything. You have been many years in
Australia. Have not such crimes been committed even there without the
perpetrators being brought to justice?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied, &quot;but Australia and London are not to be
spoken of in the same breath. There, a man may succeed in making himself lost in
wild and vast tracts of country. He can walk for days without meeting a living
soul. Here he is surrounded by his fellow-creatures.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your argument,&quot; I said, &quot;tells against yourself. Here, in the
crush and turmoil of millions, each atom with its own individual and
overwhelming cares and anxieties, the murderer is comparatively safe. No one
notices him. Why should they, in such a seething crowd? In the bush he is the
central figure; he walks along with a hang-dog look; he
<i>must</i> halt at certain places for food, and his guilty manner draws
attention upon him. In that lies his danger. But this is profitless argument.
For my part, I see no reason why the murderer of your unfortunate niece should
not be discovered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sensibly said. It must be a man who committed the deed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That has to be proved,&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Surely you don't believe it was a woman?&quot; exclaimed Mr.
Portland.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Such things have been. In these cases of mystery it is always
an error to rush at a conclusion and to set to work upon it, to the exclusion of
all others. It is as great an error to reject a theory because of its
improbability. My dear sir, nothing is improbable in this city of ours; I am
almost tempted to say that nothing is impossible. The columns of our newspapers
teem with romance which once upon a time would have been regarded as fables.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Portland looked at me thoughtfully as he said, &quot;You are
doubtless right. It needs such a mind as yours to bring the matter to light--a
mind both comprehensive and microscopic. There is some satisfaction in speaking
to you; a man hears things worth listening to. The unpractical stuff that has
been buzzing in my ears ever since I arrived from Southampton has almost driven
me crazy. Give me your careful attention for a few moments; it may be something
in your pocket.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused awhile, as though considering a point, before he
resumed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My coming home to the old country has been a bitter
disappointment to me. Quite apart from the sympathy I feel for the parents upon
whom such a dreadful blow has fallen, the news which greeted me on my arrival
has upset the plans I had formed. Over there&quot;--with a jerk of his thumb over his
right shoulder, as though Australia lay immediately in the rear of his
chair&mdash;&quot;where I made a pretty considerable fortune, I had no family ties, and was
often chewing the cud of loneliness, lamenting that I had no one to care for,
and no one to care for me. When I received the portraits of my nieces I was
captivated by them, and I thought of them continually. Here was the very thing I
was sighing for, a human tie to banish the devil of loneliness from my heart.
The beautiful young girls belonged to me in a measure, and would welcome and
love me. I should have a home to go to where I should be greeted with affection.
I won't dwell upon what I thought, because I hate a man who spins a thing out
threadbare, but you will understand it. I came home to enjoy the society of my
two beautiful nieces, and I find what you know of. Well, one poor girl has gone,
and cannot be recalled; but the other, Mary, so far as we know, is alive; and
yet she, too, disappeared last night, and nothing has been heard of her. She
must be found; if she is in danger she must be rescued; she must be restored to
her parents' arms, and to mine. Something else. The murderer of my poor niece
Lizzie must be discovered and brought to justice--must be, I say! There shall be
no miscarriage here; the villain shall not escape. Now, you--excuse me if I
speak abruptly, I mean no disrespect by it; it is only my way of speaking; and I
don't wish to be rude or to pry into your private affairs, far from it. What I
mean is, money?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I stared at him in amazement; he had stated his meaning in one
pregnant word, but he had failed in conveying to my mind any comprehension of
it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, I put it to you,&quot; he said, &quot;and I hope you'll take it
kindly. I give you my word that my intentions are good. You are not a rich man,
are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; I answered promptly; for he was so frank and open, and
was speaking in a tone of such deep concern, that I could not take offence at a
question which at other times I should have resented. &quot;I am not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you wouldn't turn your nose up at a thousand pounds?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, indeed I would not,&quot; I said heartily, wondering what on
earth the rich Australian was driving at.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, then,&quot; he said, touching my breast with his forefinger,
&quot;you discover the murderer of my poor niece Lizzie, and the thousand pounds are
yours. I will give the money to you. Something else: find my niece Mary, and
restore her to her parents and to me, and I'll make it two thousand. Come, you
don't have such a chance every day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is true,&quot; I said, and I could not help liking the old
fellow for this display of heart. &quot;But it is too remote for consideration.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all, my dear sir, not at all,&quot; and again he touched my
breast with his forefinger; &quot;there is nothing remote in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But why,&quot; I asked, not at all convinced by his insistence,
&quot;do you offer <i>me</i> such a reward, instead of going to the police?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Partly because of what you said, confirmed--though I didn't
think of it at the time you mentioned it--by what I have read, about murders
being committed in the very heart of London, without the murderers ever being
discovered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was simply stating a fact.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Exactly; and it speaks well for the police, doesn't it? But I
have only explained part of my reason for offering you the reward. It isn't
alone what you said about undiscovered murderers, it is because you spoke like a
sensible man, who, once having his finger on a clue, wouldn't let it slip till
he'd worked it right out; and like a man who, while he was working that clue,
wouldn't let others slip that might happen to come in his way. I've opened my
mind to you, and I've nothing more to say until you come to me to say something
on your own account. O, yes I have, though; I was forgetting that we're
strangers to one another, and that it wouldn't be reasonable for me to expect
you to take my word for a thousand pounds. Well, then, to show you that I am in
earnest, I lay on the table Bank of England notes for a hundred pounds. Here
they are, on account.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To my astonishment he had pulled out his pocket-book and
extracted ten ten-pound notes, and there they lay on the table before me. I
would have entreated him to take them back, feeling that it would be the falsest
of false pretences to accept them, but before I could speak again he was gone.</p>

<p class="normal">I called my wife into the room, and told her what had passed.
She regarded it in the same light as myself, but I noted a little wistful look
in her eyes as she glanced at the bank-notes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A thousand pounds!&quot; she sighed, half-longingly,
half-humorously. &quot;If we could only call it ours! Why, it would make our
fortune!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would, my dear,&quot; I said, wishing in my heart of hearts
that I had a thousand pounds of my own to throw into her lap. &quot;But this
particular thousand pounds which the good old fellow has so generously offered
will never come into our possession. So let us dismiss it from our minds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Portland,&quot; said my wife, &quot;evidently thinks you would make
a good detective.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That may or may not be, though his opinion of me is
altogether too flattering. Certainly, if I had a clue to the discovery of this
terrible mystery--&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You would follow it up,&quot; said my wife, finishing the sentence
for me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Undoubtedly I would, with courage and determination. With
such a reward in view, nothing should shake me off. I would prove myself a very
bloodhound. But there,&quot; I said, half ashamed at being led away, &quot;I am sailing in
the clouds. Let's talk no more about it. As for Mr. Portland's hundred pounds I
will put the notes carefully by, and return them to him at the first
opportunity. Poor Mrs. Melladew! How I pity her and Melladew! I shall never
forget the picture of the father sitting in that chair, moaning, 'My poor, poor
Lizzie! O, my child, my child!' It was heartbreaking.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">My wife and I talked a great deal of it during the night, and
before we went to bed I had purchased at least seven or eight newspapers of the
newsboys who passed through the street crying out new editions and latest news
of the dreadful deed. But there was nothing really new. Matters were in the same
state as when the body of the hapless girl was found in Victoria Park early in
the morning. I recognised how dangerous was the delay. Every additional hour
increased the chances of the murderer's escape from the hands of justice.</p>

<p class="normal">I did not sleep well; my slumbers were disturbed by fantastic,
horrible dreams. It was eleven o'clock on Sunday morning before I quitted my
bed.</p>

<h5>I PAY A VISIT TO MRS. LEMON.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">I must now speak of the letter which I received on the morning
of the murder, as I stood at my street-door. It was from a Mrs. Lemon,
entreating me to call upon her at any hour most convenient to me on this Sunday,
and it was couched in terms so imploring that it would have been cruel on my
part to refuse, more especially as the writer had some slight claim upon me.
Mrs. Lemon had been for many years a nurse and servant in my parents' house, and
the children were fond of her. She was then a spinster, and her name was Fanny
Peel. We used to make jokes upon it, and call her Fancy Peel, Orange Peel,
Candied Peel, Lemon Peel--and we little dreamt, when we called her Lemon Peel,
that we were unconsciously moved by the spirit of prophecy. For though she was
thirty years of age she succeeded in captivating a widower a few years older
than herself, Ephraim Lemon, a master barber and hairdresser, who used to haunt
the area. We youngsters were in the habit of watching for him and playing him
tricks, I am afraid, but nothing daunted his ardour. He proposed for Fanny, and
she accepted him. Some enterprising tradesmen, when their stock is stale or
old-fashioned, put bills in their windows announcing that no reasonable offer
will be refused. Fanny Peel, having been long on the shelf, may have thought of
this when she accepted Ephraim Lemon's hand. After her marriage she came to see
me once a year to pay her respects; but suddenly her visits became less
frequent, until they ceased altogether. For a long time past I had heard nothing
of my old nurse.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a fine morning,&quot; I said to my wife, &quot;and I shall walk
to Fanny's house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In the course of an hour I presented myself at Mrs. Lemon's
street-door, and knocked. She herself opened it to me, and after an anxious
scrutiny asked me eagerly to walk in. There was trouble in her face, tempered by
an expression of relief when she fully recognised me. She preceded me into her
little parlour, and I sat down, awaiting the communication she desired to make.
Up to the point of my sitting down the only words exchanged between us were--</p>

<p class="normal">From her: &quot;O, sir, it <i>is</i> you, and you <i>have</i>
come!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From me: &quot;Yes, Fanny; I hope I am not later than you
expected?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">From her: &quot;Not at all, sir. You always was that punkchel that
I used to time myself by you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It is a detail to state that I had not the remotest idea what
she meant by this compliment, especially as I had not made an appointment for
any particular hour. However, I did not ask her for an explanation. I addressed
her as Fanny quite naturally, and when I followed her into the parlour an odd
impression came upon me that I had gone right back into the past, and that I was
once more a little boy in pinafores.</p>

<p class="normal">The house Mrs. Lemon inhabits is situated in the north of
London, in a sadly resigned neighbourhood, which bears a shabby genteel
reputation. If I may be allowed such a form of expression I may say that it is
respectable in a demi-semi kind of way. I do not mean in respect of its morals,
which are unexceptionable, but in respect of its social position. It is situated
in a square, and is one of a cluster of tenements so exactly alike in their
frontage appearance that were it not for the numbers on the doors a man, that
way inclined, might hope for forgiveness for walking in and taking tea with his
neighbour's wife instead of with his own. In the centre of the square is an
enclosure, bounded by iron railings, which once may have been intended for the
cultivation of flowers; at the present time it contains a few ancient shrubs
which nobody ever waters, and which are, therefore, always shabby and dusty in
dry weather. Even when it rains they do not attempt to put on an air of
liveliness; it is as though they had settled down to the conviction that their
day is over. To this enclosed rural mockery, each tenant in the square is
supposed to have a key, but the only use the ground is put to is to shake
carpets in, and every person in or out of the neighbourhood is made free of it,
by reason of there being no lock to the gate. There are no signs of absolute
poverty in the square. Vagrant children do not play at &quot;shops&quot; on the doorsteps
and window-sills; organ men avoid it with a shudder; beggars walk slowly
through, and do not linger; peripatetic vendors of food never venture there; and
the donkey of the period is unfamiliar with the region. Amusement is provided
twice a week by a lanky old gentleman in a long tail coat and a frayed black
stock reaching to his ears, whose instrument is a wheezy flute, and whose
repertoire consists of &quot;The Last Rose of Summer&quot; and &quot;Away with Melancholy,&quot;
which he blows out in a fashion so unutterably mournful and dismal as to suggest
to the ingenious mind that his nightly wanderings are part of a punishment
inflicted upon him at some remote period for the commission of a dark,
mysterious crime.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's very good of you to come, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, working
her right hand slowly backwards and forwards on a faded black silk dress, which
I judged had been put on in honour of my visit. &quot;I hope you are well, sir, and
your lady, and your precious family.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I replied that my wife and children were quite well, and that
we should be glad to see her at any time. When she heard this she burst into
tears.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You always <i>was</i> the kindest-hearted gentleman!&quot; she
sobbed. &quot;You never <i>did</i> object to being put upon, and you give away your
toys that free that all the other children used to take advantage of you. But
you didn't mind, sir, not you. Over and over agin have your blessed father said
when he was alive, 'That boy'll never git along in the world, he's so soft!'&quot;
Mrs. Lemon's tears at this reminiscence flowed more freely. &quot;I can't believe,
sir, no, I can't believe as time has flown so quick since those happy, happy
days!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The happy days referred to were, of course, the days of my
childhood; and my father's prophecy, which I heard now for the first time,
respecting my future, brought a contemplative smile to my lips.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, with a sigh, &quot;if we only knew when
we was well off, what a lot of troubles we shouldn't have!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I nodded assent to this little bit of philosophy, and looked
round the room, not dreaming that in the humble apartment I was to receive a
clue to the mystery of the murder of pretty Lizzie Melladew.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_06" href="#div1Ref_06">CHAPTER VI.</a></h4>

<h5>I AM HAUNTED BY THREE EVIL-LOOKING OBJECTS IN MRS. LEMON'S ROOM.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">It was plentifully furnished: stuffed chairs and couch, the
latter with a guilty air about it which seemed to say, &quot;I am not what I seem;&quot; a
mahogany table in the centre, upon which was an album which had seen very much
better days; ornaments on the mantelshelf, bounded on each corner by a lustre
with broken pendants; a faded green carpet on the floor; two pictures on the
walls; and on a small table near the window a glass case with an evil-looking
bird in it. The pictures were portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Lemon in oil-colour.
They appeared to have been recently painted, and I made a remark to that effect.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, in a voice which struck me as
being uneasy. &quot;They was done only a few weeks ago.&quot; And then, as though the
words were forced from her against her will, &quot;Do you see a likeness, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">When she asked this question she was gazing at the portrait of
herself.</p>

<p class="normal">As a work of art, the painting was a shocking exhibition; as a
likeness, it was unmistakable.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is,&quot; I said, &quot;your very image. Is the portrait of your
husband--if that is your husband hanging there----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She interrupted me with a shudder. &quot;<i>Hanging</i> there,
sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I mean on the wall. It <i>is</i> a picture of Mr. Lemon, I
presume.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, it's him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it as faithful a portrait as your own?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's as like him, sir, as two peas. Egscept----&quot; but she
suddenly paused.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Except what, Fanny?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing, sir, nothing,&quot; she said hurriedly.</p>

<p class="normal">If, thought I, it is as like him as two peas, there must be
something extraordinarily strange and odd in Mr. Lemon. That he was not a
good-looking man could be borne with; but that, of his own free will, he should
have submitted to be painted and exhibited with such a sly, sinister expression
on his face, was decidedly not in his favour. With his thought in my mind I
turned involuntarily to the evil-looking bird in the glass case, and, singularly
enough, was struck by an absurd and fearful resemblance between the bird's beak
and the man's face. Mrs. Lemon's eyes followed mine.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you had that bird long?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not long, sir,&quot; she replied, and her voice trembled. &quot;About
as long as the pictures.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did your husband buy it in England? It is a strange bird, and
I can't find a name for it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lemon didn't buy it, sir. It was give to him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I hazarded a guess. &quot;By the artist who painted your husband's
portrait?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Turning from the stuffed bird to the fireplace, I received a
shock. In the centre of the mantelshelf was the stone figure of a creature, half
monster and half man, with a face bearing such a singular resemblance to Mr.
Lemon's and the bird's beak that I rubbed my eyes in bewilderment, believing
myself to have suddenly fallen under the influence of a devilish enchantment.
But rub my eyes as I might, I could not rub away the strange resemblance. It was
no delusion of the senses.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was that--that figure, Fanny, given to you by the artist who
painted your husband's portrait, and who presented him with that stuffed bird?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir; he give it to Lemon.&quot; And then, in a timorous
voice, she asked, &quot;Do you see anything odd in it, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is not only that it's odd,&quot; I replied; &quot;but, if you will
excuse me for saying so, Fanny, there is really something horrible about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In a low tone Mrs. Lemon said, &quot;That's egsactly as I feel,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then, why don't you get rid of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's more than I dare do, sir. There it is, and there it must
remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And there that evil-looking bird is, I suppose, and there
that must remain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, well,&quot; I said, thinking it time to get upon the track,
&quot;and now let us talk about something else. You appear to be in trouble.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may well say that, sir. I'm worn to skin and bone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm sorry to hear it, Fanny. Money troubles, I suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, no, sir! We can manage on what we've got, Lemon and me,
though he
<i>has</i> made ducks and drakes with the best part of his savings. Not money
troubles, sir; a good deal worser than that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your husband is well, I trust.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wish I could say so, sir. No, sir, he's a long way from
well, and I didn't know who else to call in, for poor dear Lemon wouldn't stand
anybody but you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Why poor dear Lemon wouldn't stand anybody but me was, to say
the least of it, inexplicable; as, since I used to catch indistinct views of his
legs when he came courting Fanny in my father's house, I had never set eyes on
him. I made no remark, however, but waited quietly for developments.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He took to his bed, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, &quot;at a quarter to
four o'clock yesterday afternoon; and it's my opinion he'll never git up from
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is bad news, Fanny. But your letter to me was written
before yesterday afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir; because I felt that things mustn't be allowed to go
on as they <i>are</i> going on without trying to alter 'em. They was bad enough
when I posted my letter to you, sir; but they're a million times worse now. My
blood's a-curdling, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Eh?&quot; I cried, much startled by this solemn matter-of-fact
description of the condition of her blood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's curdling inside me, sir, to think of what is going to
happen to Lemon!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, come, Fanny,&quot; I expostulated, &quot;you mustn't take things
so seriously; it will not mend them. What does the doctor say?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Doctor, sir? Love your heart! If I was to take a doctor into
Lemon's room now, I wouldn't answer for the consequences.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is all nonsense,&quot; I said; &quot;he must be reasoned with.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Lemon shook her head triumphantly. &quot;You may reason with
some men, sir, and you may delood a child; but reason with Lemon--I defy you,
sir!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">There was really no occasion for her to do that, as I was
there in the capacity of a friend. While we were conversing I made continual
unsuccessful attempts to avoid sight of the objects which had produced upon me
so disagreeable an impression, but I could not place myself in such a position
as to escape the whole three at one and the same time. If I turned my back upon
the evil-looking bird and the portrait of Mr. Lemon, the hideous stone figure on
the mantelshelf met my gaze; if I turned my back upon that, I not only had a
side view of the bird's beak, but a full-faced view of my friend Lemon.
Familiarity with these objects intensified my first impressions of them, and at
times I could almost fancy that their sinister features moved in mockery of me.
There was in them a fiend-like magnetism I found it impossible to resist.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Does your husband eat well?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not so well as he used to do, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; I said, hazarding a guess, &quot;he drinks a little too
much.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir, you're wrong there. He likes a glass--we none of us
despise it, sir--but he never exceeds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then, in the name of all that's reasonable, Fanny, what is
the matter with him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Lemon turned to her husband's portrait, turned to the
stone figure on the mantelshelf, turned to the evil-looking bird; and her frame
was shaken by a strong shuddering.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it anything to do with those objects?&quot; I inquired, my
wonder and perplexity growing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's what I want you to find out for me, sir, if I can so
fur trespass. Don't refuse me, sir, don't! It's a deal to ask you to do, I know,
but I shall be everlastingly grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am ready to serve you, Fanny,&quot; I said gravely, &quot;but at
present I am completely in the dark. For instance, this is the first time I have
seen those Mephistophelian-looking objects with which you have chosen to
decorate your room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I didn't choose, sir. It was done, and I daredn't go agin
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have nothing to say to that; I must wait for your
explanation. What I was about to remark was, why that evil-beaked bird----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which I wish,&quot; she interposed, &quot;had been burnt before it was
stuffed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;----Should bear so strange a resemblance,&quot; I continued, &quot;to
the portrait of your husband, and why both should bear so strange a resemblance
to the stone monster on your mantelshelf, is so very much beyond me, that I
cannot for the life of me arrive at a satisfactory solution of the mystery.
Surely it cannot spring from a diseased imagination, for you have the same fancy
as myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It ain't fancy, sir; it's fact. And the sing'lar part of it
is that the party as brought them all three into the house is as much like them
as they are to each other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We're getting on solid ground,&quot; I said. &quot;The party who
brought them into the house--who gave you the stone monster, who painted your
husband's portrait and yours, who stuffed the bird; for, doubtless, he was the
taxidermist. An Admirable Crichton, indeed, in the way of accomplishments! You
see, Fanny, you are introducing me to new acquaintances. You have not mentioned
this party before. A man, I presume.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose so, sir,&quot; she said, with an awestruck look.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why suppose?&quot; I asked. &quot;In such a case, supposition is
absurd. He is, or is not, a man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us call him so, sir. It'll make things easier.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very much easier, and they will be easier still if you will
be more explicit. I seem to be getting more and more in the dark. In looking
again upon your portrait, Fanny----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can almost discern a likeness to----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For the merciful Lord's sake, sir,&quot; she cried, &quot;don't say
that! If I thought so, I should go mad. I'm scared enough already with what has
occurred and the trouble I'm in--and Lemon talking in his sleep all the night
through, and having the most horrible nightmares--and me trembling and shaking
in my bed with what I'm forced to hear--it's unbearable, sir; it's unbearable!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I was becoming very excited. Unless Mrs. Lemon had lost her
senses, there was in this common house a frightful and awful mystery. And Mrs.
Lemon had sent for me to fathom it! What was I about to hear--what to discover?</p>

<p class="normal">I strove to speak in a calm voice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You say your husband took to his bed yesterday, and that you
fear he will never rise from it. Then he is in bed at this moment?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where is his bedroom?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On the first floor back, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can he hear us talking?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you want me to see him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Before you go, sir, if you have no objections. I sha'n't know
how to thank you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do what I can for you, Fanny. First for your own sake,
and next because there appears to be something going on in this house that ought
to be brought to light.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You may well say that, sir. Not only in this house, but out
of this house. The good Lord above only knows what <i>is</i> going on! But
Lemon's done nothing wrong, sir. I won't have him thought badly of, and I won't
have him hurt. He's been weak, yes, sir, but he ain't been guilty of a wicked,
horrible crime. It ain't in his nature, sir. When I first begun to hear things
that he used to say in his sleep, and sometimes when he was awake and lost to
everything, my hair used to stand on end. I could feel it stirring up, giving me
the creeps all over my skin, and my heart'd beat that quick that it was a mercy
it didn't jump out of my body. But after a time, frightened as I was, and
getting no satisfaction out of Lemon, who only glared at me when I spoke to him,
I thought the time might come--and I ain't sure it won't be this blessed
day--when I should have to come forward as a witness to save him from the
gallows. I am his wife, sir, and if he ain't fit to look after hisself, it's for
me to look after him, and so, sir, I thought the best thing for me to do was to
keep a dairy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A dairy!&quot; I echoed, in wonder.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, a dairy--to put down in writing everything what
happened at the very time.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O,&quot; I said, &quot;you mean a diary!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If that's what you call it, sir. I got an old lodger's book
that wasn't all filled up. I keep it locked in my desk, sir. Perhaps you'd like
to look at it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It may be as well, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; she said, fumbling in her pocket for a key, and placing
one by one upon the table the most extraordinary collection of oddments that
female pocket was ever called upon to hold, &quot;if, when we come into this house to
retire and live genteel, after Lemon had sold his business, I'd have known what
was to come out of my notion to let the second floor front to a single man, I'd
have had my feet cut off before I'd done it. But I did it for the best, to keep
down the egspenses. Here it is, sir.&quot;</p>

<h4><a name="div1_07" href="#div1Ref_07">CHAPTER VII.</a></h4>

<h5>DEVLIN'S FIRST INTRODUCTION INTO THE MYSTERY.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">She had found the key she had been searching for, and now she
opened a mahogany desk, from which she took a penny memorandum-book. She handed
it to me in silence, and I turned over the leaves. Most of the pages were filled
with weekly accounts of her lodgers, in which &quot;ham and eggs, 8<i>d </i>.;&quot; &quot;a
rasher, 5<i>d </i>.;&quot; &quot;chop, 8<i>d </i>.;&quot; &quot;two boyled eggs, 3<i>d </i>.;&quot;
&quot;bloater, 2<i>d </i>.;&quot; &quot;crewet, 4<i>d </i>.;&quot; and other such-like items
appeared again and again. There was also, at the foot of pages, receipts for
payment, &quot;Paid, Fanny Lemon.&quot; And this, in the midst of the presumably tragic
business upon which we were engaged, brought to my mind an anomaly which had
often occurred to me, namely, that landladies should present their accounts to
their lodgers in penny memorandum-books, should receive the money, should sign a
receipt, and then take away the books containing their acknowledgment of
payment. In view of the grave issues impending, it is a trivial matter to
comment upon, but it was really a relief to me to dwell for a moment or two upon
it. At the end of the memorandum-book which I was looking through were five or
six leaves which had not been utilised for lodgers' accounts, and these Mrs.
Lemon had pressed into service for her diary. She was a bad writer and an
indifferent speller, and the entries were brief, and, to me, at that point,
incomprehensible.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see, Fanny,&quot; I said &quot;that your first entry is made on a
Thursday, a good many weeks ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must confess I can make nothing of it. It states that Lemon
rose at eight o'clock on that morning, that he had breakfast at half-past eight,
that he ate four slices of bread and butter, two rashers of bacon, and two
eggs----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; sighed Mrs. Lemon, interrupting me. &quot;He had his appetite
then, had Lemon! He ain't got none now to speak of.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And,&quot; I continued, &quot;that he went out of the house at nine
o'clock with a person whose name is unintelligible. It commences, I think, with
a D.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;D-e-v-l-i-n,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, her eyes almost starting out
of her head as she spelt the name, letter by letter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can make it out now. That is it, Devlin. A peculiar name,
Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Everything about him is that, sir, and worse.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Had it been a common name, I daresay I should have made it
out at once. Now, Fanny, who is this Devlin?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You called him a man, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Lemon, striving
unsuccessfully to keep her eyes from the portrait of her husband, from the
evil-beaked bird, and from the image of the stone monster on the mantelshelf.</p>

<p class="normal">The magnetism was not in her, it was in the objects, and as
she turned from one to the other I also turned--as though I were a piece of
machinery and she was setting me in motion. But it is likely that my eyes would
have wandered in those directions without her silent prompting. One peculiarity
of the fascination--growing more horrible every moment--exercised by the three
objects, was that I could not look upon the one without being compelled to
complete the triangle formed by the positions in which they were placed--the
wall, the window, the mantelshelf.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was Devlin, then,&quot; I said, &quot;who painted the portraits and
stuffed the bird and gave you the stone monster?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You've guessed it, sir. It was him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Referring to the entry in the memorandum-book, I asked, &quot;Did
this Devlin call for your husband on the Thursday morning that they went out
together?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir, he lodged here.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Does he lodge here now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, I am sorry to say. If I could only see the last of
him I'd give thanks on my bended knees morning, noon, and night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why don't you get rid of him, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I accepted this as part of the mystery, and did not press her
on the point, but I asked why she would feel so grateful if he were gone from
the house.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because,&quot; she replied, &quot;it's all through him that Lemon is as
he is.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Am I to see this man before I leave?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It ain't for me to say, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he in the house now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I inwardly resolved if he came into the house before I left
it, that I would see the man of whom Mrs. Lemon so evidently stood in dread.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I suppose, Fanny, you will tell me something more of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is why I asked you to come, sir. If you're to do any
good in this dreadful affair, you must know as much as I do about him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well, Fanny.&quot; I referred again to the first entry in the
diary. &quot;After stating that your husband went out with Devlin at nine o'clock in
the morning, you say that he returned alone at six o'clock in the evening, and
that he did not stir out of the house again on that night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see that you have made a record of the time Lemon went to
bed and the time he rose next morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To which, sir, I am ready to take my gospel oath.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Supposing your gospel oath to be necessary.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It might be. God only knows!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I stared at her, beginning to doubt whether she was sane; but
there was nothing in her face to justify my suspicion. The expression I saw on
it was one of solemn, painful, intense earnestness.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go on, sir,&quot; she said, &quot;if you please.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I turned again to the concluding words of the first entry, and
read them aloud:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Devlin did not come home all night. I locked the street-door
myself, and put up the chain. I went down at seven in the morning, when Lemon
was asleep, and the chain was up. I went to Devlin's room, the second floor
front, and Devlin was not there!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's true, sir. I can take my gospel oath of that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fanny,&quot; I said, with the little book in my hand, closed, but
keeping my forefinger between the leaves upon which the first entry was made, &quot;I
cannot go any farther until you tell me what all this means.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;After you've finished what I wrote, sir,&quot; was her reply,
&quot;I'll make a clean breast of it, and tell you everything, or as much of it as I
can remember, from the time you saw me last--a good many years ago, wasn't it,
sir?--up to this very day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I thought it best to humour her, and I looked through the
remaining entries. They were all of the same kind. Mr. Lemon rose in the morning
at such a time; he had breakfast at such a time; he went out at such a time,
with or without Devlin; he came home at such a time, with or without Devlin; and
so on, and so on. It was a peculiar feature in these entries that Lemon never
went out or came home without Devlin's name being mentioned.</p>

<p class="normal">I handed the book back to her; she took it irresolutely, and
asked,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you read what I last wrote, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, Fanny, the usual thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps, sir, but the time I wrote it; that is what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, Fanny, I don't think I noticed that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was wrote yesterday, sir, and it fixes the time that Lemon
came home on Friday, and that he didn't stir out of the house all the night. If
I can swear to anything, sir, I can swear to that. Lemon never crossed the
street-door from the minute he came in on Friday to the minute he went out agin
yesterday. If it was the last word I spoke, I'd swear to it, and it's the truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help me God!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I was about to inquire why she laid such particular stress
upon these recent movements of her husband, when there flashed into her eyes an
expression of such absolute terror and horror that my first thought was that a
spectre had entered the room noiselessly, and was standing at my back. Before I
had time to turn and look, Mrs. Lemon clutched my arm, and gasped,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you hear that? Do you hear that?&quot;</p>
<br>

<h5>I MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF GEORGE CARTON'S GUARDIAN, MR. KENNETH DOWSETT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">I heard something certainly which by this time, unhappily, was
neither new nor strange. It was the voice of a newsboy calling out the last
edition of a newspaper which, he asserted with stentorian lungs, contained
further particulars of the awful murder in Victoria Park. Amid all the jargon he
was bawling out, there were really only three words clearly distinguishable.
&quot;Murder! Awful murder! Discoveries! Awful discoveries!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you alarmed, Fanny,&quot; I asked, &quot;by what that boy is
calling out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; she replied in a whisper, &quot;it is that, it is that!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you must be familiar with the cry,&quot; I observed. &quot;There
isn't a street in London that was not ringing with it all yesterday.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It don't matter, it don't matter!&quot; she gasped, in the most
inexplicable state of agitation I had ever beheld. &quot;Lemon never stirred out of
the house. I'll take my solemn oath of it--my solemn oath.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I released myself from her grasp, and, running into the
square, caught up with the newsvendor and bought a paper. Before I returned to
the house I satisfied myself that the paper contained nothing new in the shape
of intelligence relating to the murder of my friend Melladew's daughter. What
the man had bawled out was merely a trick to dispose of his wares. I had reached
the doorstep of Fanny's house when my attention was arrested by the figures of
two men on the opposite side of the road. One was a man of middle age, and was a
stranger to me. In his companion I immediately recognised George Carton. The
elder man appeared to be endeavouring to prevail upon George Carton to leave the
square, but his arguments had no effect upon Carton, who, shaking him off,
hurried across the road to speak to me. His companion followed him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Any news, sir?&quot; cried George Carton. &quot;Have you discovered
anything?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing,&quot; I replied, not pausing to inquire why he should put
a question so direct to me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing!&quot; he muttered. &quot;Nothing! But it shall be brought to
light--it shall, or I will not live!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come, come, my dear boy,&quot; said the elder man. &quot;What is the
use of going on in this frantic manner? It won't better things.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How am I to be sure of that?&quot; retorted Carton. &quot;It won't
better things to stand idly aside, and think and think about it without ever
moving a step.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My ward knows you, sir,&quot; said Carton's friend, &quot;and I confess
I was endeavouring to persuade him to come home with me when you were running
after the newspaper boy. He insisted that your sudden appearance in this square
was a strange and eventful coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A strange and eventful coincidence!&quot; I exclaimed, and
thought, without giving my thought expression, that there was something strange
in the circumstance of my being in Fanny Lemon's house, about to listen to a
revelation which was not unlikely to have some bearing upon the tragic event,
and in being thus unexpectedly confronted by the young man who was to have been
married to the murdered girl.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, that is his idea,&quot; said Carton's friend; &quot;but I am
really forgetting my manners. Allow me to introduce myself. You are acquainted
with my ward, George Carton, the dearest, most generous-hearted, most
magnanimous young fellow in the world. I have the happiness to be his guardian.
My name is Kenneth Dowsett.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was a smiling, fair-faced man, with blue, dreamy eyes, and
his voice and manners were most agreeable. I murmured that I was very pleased to
make his acquaintance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My ward,&quot; continued Mr. Dowsett, laying his hand
affectionately on Carton's shoulder, &quot;has also an odd idea in reference to this
dreadful affair, that something significant and pregnant will be discovered in
an odd and unaccountable fashion. Heaven knows, I don't want to deprive him of
any consolation he can derive from his imaginings. I have too sincere a love for
him; but I am a man of the world, and it grieves me to see him indulge in
fancies which can lead to no good result. To tell you the honest truth,&quot; Mr.
Dowsett whispered to me, &quot;I am afraid to let him out of my sight for fear he
should do violence to himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear guardian,&quot; said Carton, &quot;who should know better than
I how kind and good you are to me? Who should be better able to appreciate the
tenderness and consideration I have always received at your hands? I may be
wilful, headstrong, but I am not ungrateful. Indeed, sir&quot;--turning to me--&quot;I am
wild with grief and despair, and my guardian has the best of reasons for chiding
me. He has only my good at heart, and I am truly sorry to distress him; but I
have my ideas--call them fancies if you like--and I must have something to cling
to. I will not abandon my pursuit till the murderer is brought to justice, or
till I kill him with my own hands!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is how he has been going on,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, &quot;all day
yesterday, and the whole live-long night. He hasn't had a moment's sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sleep!&quot; cried Carton. &quot;Who could sleep under such agony as I
am suffering?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; I said to the young man, whose intense earnestness
deepened my sympathy for him, &quot;sleep is necessary. It isn't possible to work
without it. There are limits to human strength, and if you wish to be of any
service in the clearing up of this mystery, you must conduct yourself with some
kind of human wisdom.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There, my dear lad,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, &quot;doesn't that tally
with my advice? I tried to prevail upon him last night to take an opiate----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I wouldn't,&quot; interrupted Carton, &quot;and I said I would
never forgive you if you administered it to me without my knowledge. Never,
never will I take another!&quot; Mr. Dowsett looked at him reproachfully, and the
young man added, &quot;There--I beg your pardon. I did not mean to refer to it
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I have erred at all in my behaviour towards you, my dear
lad, it is on the side of indulgence. Still,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, addressing me,
&quot;that does not mean that I shall give up endeavouring to persuade George to do
what is sensible. As matters stand, who is the better judge, he or I? Just look
at the state he is in now, and tell me whether he is fit to be trusted alone. My
fear is that he will break down entirely.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I agree with your guardian,&quot; I said to Carton; &quot;he is your
best adviser.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know, I know,&quot; said the young man, &quot;and I ought to be
ashamed of myself for causing him so much uneasiness. But, after all, sir, I am
not altogether in the wrong. I saw Mr. Portland last night, and he said that you
and he had had an important interview about this dreadful occurrence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was not aware,&quot; I observed, &quot;that you were acquainted with
any of the elder members of your poor Lizzie's family.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was not,&quot; rejoined Carton, &quot;till last night. I introduced
myself to Mr. Portland, and told him all that had passed between poor Lizzie and
me. I did not have courage enough to go and see Mr. and Mrs. Melladew, but Mr.
Portland was very kind to me, and he said that you had undertaken to unravel the
mystery.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I did not contradict this unauthorised statement on the part
of Mr. Portland, not wishing to get into an argument and prolong the
conversation unnecessarily; indeed, it would have been disingenuous to say
anything to the contrary, for it really seemed to me in some dim way that I was
on the threshold of a discovery in connection with the murder.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Hearing this welcome news from Mr. Portland,&quot; continued
Carton, &quot;you would not have me believe that my meeting with you now in a square
I never remember to have passed through in my life is accidental? No, there is
more in it than you or I can explain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What brought you here, then?&quot; I inquired. &quot;Were you aware I
was in this neighbourhood?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; replied Carton, &quot;I had not the slightest idea of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He followed the newsboy,&quot; explained Mr. Dowsett, &quot;of whom you
bought a paper just now. These people, crying out the dreadful news, excercise a
kind of fascination over my dear George. I give you my word, he seems to be in a
waking dream as he follows in their footsteps.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am in no dream,&quot; said Carton. &quot;I am on the alert, on the
watch. I gaze at the face of every man and woman I pass for signs of guilt.
Where is the murderer, the monster who took the life of my poor girl? Not in
hiding! It would draw suspicion upon him. He is in the streets, and I may meet
him. If I do, if I do----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You see,&quot; whispered Mr. Dowsett to me, &quot;how easy it would be
for him to get into serious trouble if he had not a friend at his elbow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What good,&quot; I said, addressing Carton, &quot;can you, in reason,
expect to accomplish by wearing yourself out in the way you are doing?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will lead me to the end,&quot; replied Carton, putting his hand
to his forehead; and there was in his tone, despite his denial, a dreaminess
which confirmed Mr. Dowsett's remark, &quot;and then I do not care what becomes of
me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett gazed at his ward solicitously, and passed his arm
around him sympathisingly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Would it be a liberty, sir,&quot; said Carton, &quot;to ask what brings
you here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came on a visit to an old friend,&quot; I replied evasively,
&quot;whom I have not seen for years, and who wished to consult me upon her private
affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me for my rudeness,&quot; he said, with a pitiful,
deprecatory movement of his shoulders. &quot;In what you have undertaken for Mr.
Portland, will you accept my assistance?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I see that it is likely to be of any service, yes, most
certainly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give me something to do,&quot; he said in a husky tone, &quot;give me
some clue to follow. This suspense is maddening.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will do what I can. And now I must leave you. My friend
will wonder what is detaining me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But one word more, sir. Have you heard any news of Mary?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. So far as I know, she is still missing. If we could
find her we should, perhaps, learn the truth.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Should you need me,&quot; said Carton, &quot;you know my address. I
gave you my card yesterday, but you may have mislaid it. Here is another. I live
with my guardian. It is a good thing for me that I am not left alone. But, good
God! what am I saying? I <i>am</i> alone--alone! My Lizzie, my poor Lizzie, is
dead!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As I turned into the house I caught a last sight of him
standing irresolutely on the pavement, his guardian in the kindest and tenderest
manner striving to draw him away.</p>

<p class="normal">Fanny was waiting for me at the door of her little parlour.
There was a wild apprehensive look in her eyes as they rested on my face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What has kep you so long, sir?&quot; she asked in a low tone of
fear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I came across an acquaintance accidentally,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A policeman, sir, or a detective?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good heavens, neither!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="normal">A sigh of relief escaped her, but immediately afterwards she
became anxious again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You was talking a long time, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was not my fault, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was--was Lemon's name mentioned, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was there nothing said about him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not a word.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This assurance plainly took a weight from her mind. She
glanced at the paper I held in my hand, and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there anything new in it, sir? Is the murderer caught?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; I replied; &quot;the paper contains nothing that has not
appeared in a hundred other newspapers yesterday and to-day. Fanny, I am about
to speak to you now very seriously.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'm listening, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has Mr. Lemon, your husband, anything to do with this
dreadful deed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He had no hand in it, sir, as I hope for mercy! I'll tell you
everything I know, as I said I would; but it must be in my own way, and you
mustn't interrupt me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I decided that it would be useless to put any further
questions to her, and that I had best listen patiently to what she was about to
impart. I told her that I would give her my best attention, and I solemnly
impressed upon her the necessity of concealing nothing from me. She nodded, and
pouring out a glass of water, drank it off. A silence of two or three minutes
intervened before she had sufficiently composed herself to commence, and during
that silence the feeling grew strong within me that Providence had directed my
steps to her house.</p>

<p class="normal">The tale she related I now set down in her own words as nearly
as I can recall them. Of all the stories I had ever heard or read, this which
she now imparted to me was the most fantastic and weird, and it led directly to
a result which to the last hour of my life I shall think of with wonder and
amazement.</p>

<h5>FANNY LEMON RELATES UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES SHE RESOLVED TO LET HER SECOND
FLOOR FRONT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must go back sir,&quot; she commenced, &quot;a few years, else you
won't be able to understand it properly. I'll run over them years as quick as
possible, and won't say more about e'm than is necessary, because I know you are
as anxious as I am to come to the horrible thing that has just happened. I was a
happy woman in your angel father's house, but when Lemon come a-courting me I
got that unsettled that I hardly knew what I was about. Well, sir, as you know,
we got married, and I thought I was made for life, and that honey was to be my
portion evermore. I soon found out my mistake, though I don't suppose I had more
to complain of than other women. In the early days things went fairly well
between me and Lemon. We had our little fall-outs and our little differences,
but they was soon made up. We ain't angels, sir, any of us, and when we're tied
together we soon find it out. I daresay it's much of a muchness on the men's
side as well as on our'n. Lemon is quick-tempered, but it's all over in a
minute, and he forgits and forgives. Leastways, that is how it used to be with
him; he would fly out at me like a flash of lightning, and be sorry for it
afterwards; and one good thing in him was that he never sulked and never
brooded. It ain't so now; he's growed that irritable that it takes more than a
woman's patience to bear with him; he won't stand contradiction, and the
littlest of things'll frighten him and make him as weak as a child unborn. There
was only a couple of nights ago. He'd been going on that strange that it was as
much as I could do to keep from screaming out loud and alarming the
neighbourhood, and right in the middle of it all he fell asleep quite sudden. It
was heavenly not to hear the sound of his voice, but I couldn't help pitying him
when I saw him laying there, with the prespiration starting out of his forehead,
and I took a cool handkercher and wiped the damp away, and smoothed his hair
back from his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He woke up as sudden as he went off, and when he felt my hand
on his head he burst out crying and begged me to forgive him. Not for the way
he'd been storming at me--no, sir, he didn't beg my forgiveness for that, but
for something else he wouldn't or couldn't understandingly explain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What do you mean by it all?' I said. 'What do you mean by it
all?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But though I as good as went on my bended knees to git it out
of him, it wasn't a bit of good. I might as well have spoke to a stone stature.
Lemon's had a scare, sir, a frightful awful scare, and I don't know what to
think.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I married him, sir, he kep a saloon, as I daresay you
remember hearing of; shaving threepence, hair-cutting fourpence, shampooing
ditter. He had a wax lady's head in the winder as went round by machinery, and
Lemon kep it regularly wound up with her hair dressed that elegant that it would
have been a credit to Burlington Arcade. There used to be a crowd round his
winder all day long, and girls and boys 'd come a long way to have a good look
at it; and though I say it, she was worth looking at. Her lips was like bits of
red coral, and you could see her white teeth through 'em; her skin was that
pearly and her cheeks that rosy as I never saw equalled; and as for her eyes,
sir, they was that blue that they had to be seen to be believed. She carried her
head on one side as she went round and round, looking slantways over her right
shoulder, and, taking her altogether, she was as pritty a exhibition as you
could see anywheres in London. It brought customers to Lemon, there was no doubt
of that; he was doing a splendid trade, and we put by a matter of between four
and five pounds a week after all expenses paid. It <i>did</i> go agin me, I own,
when I discovered that Lemon had female customers, and, what's more, a private
room set apart to do 'em up in; but when I spoke to him about he said, with a
stern eye:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What do you object to? The ladies?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Not so much the ladies, Lemon,' I answered, 'as the private
room.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'O,' said he, 'the private room?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' said I; 'I don't think it proper.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't you?' said he, getting nasty. 'Well, I do, and there's
a end of it. You mind your business, Fanny, and I'll mind mine.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saw that he meant it and didn't intend to give way, and I
consequenchually held my tongue. Even when I was told that Lemon often went out
to private houses to dress ladies' hair I thought it best to say nothing. I had
my feelings, but I kep 'em to myself. I'm for peace and harmony, sir, and I wish
everybody was like me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;One night Lemon give me a most agreeable surprise. He came
home and said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Fanny, what would you like best in the world?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was a question to put to a woman! I thought of
everything, without giving anything a name. The truth is I was knocked over, so
to speak.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lemon spoke up agin. 'What would you say, Fanny, if I told
you I was going to sell the business and retire?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, Lemon!' I cried, for I thought, he was trying me with
one of his jokes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, Fanny,' he said, 'it's what I've made up my mind to.
I've been thinking of it a long time, and now I'm going to do it.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I saw that he was in real rightdown earnest, and I was that
glad that I can't egspress.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I said, when I got cool, 'can we afford it?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Old woman,' he answered 'we've got a matter of a hundred and
fifty pound a year to live on, and if that ain't enough for the enjoyment of
life, I should like to know how much more you want?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He had his light moments had Lemon before certain things
happened. People as didn't know him well thought him nothing but a grumpy,
crusty man. Well, sir, he <i>was</i> that mostly, but with them as was intimate
he cracked his joke now and then, and it used to do my heart good to hear him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So it was settled, sir. Lemon actually sold his business, and
we retired. Five year ago almost to the very day we took this house and become
fashionable.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was a bit dull at first. Lemon missed his shop, and his
customers, and his wax lady, that he'd growed to look upon almost like flesh and
blood; but he practised on my head for hours together with his crimping irons
and curling tongs, and that consoled him a little. He used to pretend it was all
real, and that I was one of his reg'lars, and while he was gitting his things
ready he'd speak about the weather and the news in a manner quite perfessional.
When he come into the room of a morning at eleven or twelve o'clock with his
white apern on and his comb stuck in his hair, and say, 'Good morning, ma'am, a
beautiful day,'--which was the way he always begun, whether it was raining or
not--I'd take my seat instanter in the chair, and he'd begin to operate. I
humoured him, sir! it was my duty to; and though he often screwed my hair that
tight round the tongs that I felt as if my eyes was starting out of my head, I
never so much as murmured.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We went on in this way for nearly three years, and then Lemon
took another turn. Being retired, and living, like gentlefolk, on our income, we
got any number of circulars, and among 'em a lot about companies, and how to
make thousands of pounds without risking a penny. I never properly understood
how it came about; all I know is that Lemon used to set poring over the papers
and writing down figgers and adding 'em up, and that at last he got speculating
and dabbling and talking wild about making millions. From that time he spoke
about nothing but Turks, and Peruvians, and Egyptians, and Bulls, and Bears, and
goodness only knows what other outlandish things; and sometimes he'd come home
smiling, and sometimes in such a dreadful temper that I was afraid to say a word
to him. One thing, after a little while, I did understand, and that was that
Lemon was losing money instead of making it by his goings on with his Turks, and
Peruvians, and Egyptians, and his Bulls and Bears; and as I was beginning to git
frightened as to how it was all going to end, I plucked up courage to say,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon, is it worth while?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And all the thanks I got was,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Jest you hold your tongue. Haven't I got enough to worrit me
that you must come nagging at me?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He snapped me up so savage that I didn't dare to say another
word, but before a year was out he sung to another tune. He confessed to me with
tears in his eyes that he'd been chizzled out of half the money we retired on,
and it was a blessed relief to me to hear him say,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I've done with it, Fanny, for ever. They don't rob me no
longer with their Bulls and their Bears.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'A joyful hour it is to me. Lemon,' I cried, 'to hear them
words. The life I've led since you took up with Bulls and Bears and all the
other trash, there's no describing. But now we can be comfortable once more.
Never mind the money you've lost; I'll make it up somehow.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was then I got the idea of letting the second floor front.
As it's turned out, sir, it was the very worst idea that ever got into my head,
and what it's going to lead to the Lord above only knows.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_10" href="#div1Ref_10">CHAPTER X.</a></h4>

<h5>DEVLIN THE BARBER TAKES FANNY'S FIRST FLOOR FRONT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Our first lodger, sir, was a clerk in the City, and he played
the bassoon that excruciating that our lives become a torment. The neighbours
all complained, and threatened to bring me and Lemon and the young man and his
bassoon before the magerstrates. I told the clerk that he'd have to give up the
second floor front or the bassoon, and that he might take his choice. He took
his choice, and went away owing me one pound fourteen, and I haven't seen the
colour of his money from that day to this.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Our second lodger was a printer, who worked all night and
slep all day. I could have stood him if it hadn't turned out that he'd run away
from his wife, who found out where he was living, and give us no peace. She was
a dreadful creature, and I never saw her sober. She smelt of gin that strong
that you knew a mile off when she was coming. 'That's why I left her, Mrs.
Lemon,' the poor man said to me; 'she's been the ruin of me. Three homes has she
sold up, and she's that disgraced me that it makes me wild to hear the sound of
her voice. The law won't help me, and what am I to do?' I made him a cup of tea,
and said I was very sorry for him, but that she wasn't <i>my</i> wife, and that
I'd take it kind of him if he'd find some other lodgings. All he said was, 'Very
well, Mrs. Lemon, I can't blame you; but don't be surprised if you read in the
papers one day that I am brought up for being the death of her, or that I've
made a hole in the water. If she goes on much longer, one of them things is sure
to happen.' He went away sorrowful, and paid me honourable to the last farthing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It wasn't encouraging, sir, but I didn't lose heart. 'The
third time's lucky,' I said to myself, as I put the bill in the winder agin,
little dreaming what was to come of it. It remained there nigh on a fortnight,
when a knock come at the street-door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do all the work in the house myself. A body may be genteel
without keeping a parcel of servants to eat you out of house and home, and sauce
you in the bargain. A knock come at the street-door, as I said. If I'd known
what I know now, the party as knocked might have knocked till he was blue in the
face, or dropped down in a fit before he'd got me to answer him. But I had no
suspicions, and I went and opened the door, and there I saw a tall, dark man,
with a black moustache, curled up at the ends.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You've got a bill in the winder,' said he, 'of a room to
let.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, sir,' I answered, hardly giving myself time to look at
him, I was that glad of the chance of letting the room; 'would you like to see
it?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I should,' said he.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And in he walked, and up the stairs, after me, to the second
floor front. It didn't strike me at the time, but it did often afterwards when I
listened for 'em in vain, that I didn't hear his footsteps as he follered me
up-stairs. Never, from the moment he entered this house, have I heard the least
sound from his feet, and yet he wears what looks like boots. He's never asked me
to clean 'em, and I'd rather be torn to pieces with red hot pinchers than do it
now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It's a cheerful room, sir,' said I to him. 'Looks out on the
square.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Charming,' he said, 'the room, the square, you, everything.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'That's a funny way of talking,' I thought, and I said out
loud, 'Do you think it will suit, sir?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Do I think it will suit?' he said. 'I am sure it will suit.
I take it from this minute. What's the rent?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'With attendance, sir?' I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'With or without attendance,' he answered; 'it matters not.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not 'It don't matter,' as ordinary people say, but 'It
matters not,' for all the world like one of them foreign fellers we see on the
stage. I told him the rent, reckoning attendance, and he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Good. The bargain is made. I am yours, and you are mine.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And then he laughed in a way that almost made my hair stand
on end. It wasn't the laugh of a human creature; there was something unearthly
about it. As a rule, a body's pleased when another body laughs, but this laugh
made me shiver all over; you know the sensation, sir, like cold water running
down your back. Then, and a good many times since when he's been speaking or
laughing, I felt myself turn faint with sech a swimming sensation that I had to
ketch hold of something to keep myself from sinking to the ground.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I beg your pardon, sir,' I said, when I come to, 'but if
you've no objections I'd like a reference.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Of course you would,' he said, laughing again, 'and here it
is.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With that he gives me a sovering, and orders me to light the
fire. There's that about him as makes it unpossible not to do as he orders you
to, so on my knees I went there and then, and lit the fire.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Good,' he said. 'I couldn't have done it better myself. Mrs.
Lemon--' and you might have knocked me down with a feather when I heard him
speak my name. How did he get to know it? <i>I</i> never told him.--Mrs. Lemon,'
said he, 'I see in your face that you'd like to ask me a question or two.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I would, sir,' I said, shaking and trembling all over. 'If I
may make so bold, sir, are you a married man?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He put his hand on his heart, and, grinning all over his
face, answered, 'Mrs. Lemon, I am, and have ever been, single.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Might I be so bold as to ask your name, sir?' I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Devlin,' said he.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Dev--what?' I garsped.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lin,' said he. 'Devlin. I'll spell it for you. D-e-v-l-i-n.
Have you got it well in your mind?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I have, sir,' I said, very faint.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Good,' said he, pointing to the door. 'Go.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had to go, sir, and I went, and that is how Mr. Devlin
become our lodger.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_11" href="#div1Ref_11">CHAPTER XI.</a></h4>

<h5>DEVLIN PERFORMS SOME WONDERFUL TRICKS, FASCINATES MR. LEMON, AND STRIKES
TERROR TO THE SOUL OF FANNY LEMON.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;That very night Mr. Devlin come down to this room, without
'with your leave or by your leave,' where Lemon and me was setting, having our
regular game of cribbage for a ha'penny a game, and droring a chair up to the
table, he begun to talk as though he'd known us all his life. And he can talk,
sir, by the hour, and it never seens to tire him, whatever it does with other
people. Lemon was took with him, and couldn't keep his eyes off him. No more
could I, sir. No more could you if he was here. You might try your hardest, but
it wouldn't be a bit of good. There's something in him as forces you to look at
him--just as there's something in that bird, and the stone figger on the
mantelshelf, and Lemon's portrait as forces you to look at <i>them</i>. I've
found out the reason of that. When Devlin ain't here <i>he leaves his sperrit
behind him</i>--that's how it is. I was never frightened of the dark before he
come into the house, but now the very thought of going into a room of a night
without a candle makes me shiver. And many and many's the time as I've been
going up-stairs that I've turned that faint there's no describing. He's been
behind me, sir, coming up after me, step by step. I can't see him, I can't hear
him, but I feel him; and yet there ain't a soul in sight but me. At them times
I'm frightened to look at the wall for fear of seeing his shadder.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir, on the night that he come into this parlour he
goes on talking and talking, and then proposes a hand at cribbage, which Lemon
was only too glad to say yes to.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Mrs. Lemon must play,' said Devlin; 'we'll have a
three-handed game.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shouldn't have minded being left out, especially as our
cribbage-board only pegs for two, but his word was lore. So we begun to play,
and Devlin marks his score with a red pencil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The things he did while we played made my flesh creep. He
threw out his card for crib without looking at it, and told us how much was in
crib while the cards was laying backs up on the table; and when Lemon and me,
both of us slow counters, began to reckon what we had in our hands, Mr. Devlin,
like a flash of lightning, cried out how many we was to take. We played five
games, and he won 'em all. Then he said he'd show us some tricks. Sir, the like
of them tricks was never seen before or since. I've seen conjurers in my time,
but not one who could hold a candle to Mr. Devlin. He made the cards fly all
over the room, and while he held the pack in his hand and you was looking at
'em, they'd disappear before your very eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Where would you like 'em to be?' he asked. 'Underneath you,
on your chair? Git up; you're sitting on 'em. In your workbox? Open it and
behold 'em.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And there they was, sir, sure enough, underneath me, though
I'd never stirred from my seat, or in my workbox, which was at the other end of
the room. It wasn't conjuring, sir, it was something I can't put a name to, and
it wasn't natural. I could hardly move for fright, and as I looked at Mr.
Devlin, he seemed to grow taller and thinner, and his black eyes become blacker,
and his moustaches curled up to his nose till they as good as met. But Lemon
didn't feel as I felt; he was that delighted that he kep on crying--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Wonderful! Beautiful! Do it agin, Mr. Devlin, do it agin.
Show us another.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know when I've seen him so excited; that Devlin had
bewitched him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We're brothers you and me,' said Devlin to him. 'I am yours,
and you are mine, and we'll never part.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The very words, sir, he'd used to me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Hooray!' cried Lemon, 'we're brothers, you and me, and we'll
never, never part.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I once kep a barber's shop myself,' said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What!' cried Lemon, 'are you one of us?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I am,' said Devlin, 'and I've worked for the best in the
trade--for Truefitt and Shipwright, and all the rest of 'em. I've been abroad
studying the new styles. I'll show you something as 'll make you open your eyes,
something splendid.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And before I knew where I was, sir, Devlin, in his
shirt-sleeves, had whipped a large towel round my neck, and had my hair all
down, and was beginning to dress it. Where he got the towel from, and the combs,
and the curling-tongs, and the fire, goodness only knows. I didn't see him take
them from nowhere, but there they was on the table, and there was Devlin, with
his hands in my hair, frizzling it up and corkscrewing it, and twisting and
twirling it, and me setting in the chair for all the world as if I'd been turned
into stone. But though I didn't have the power to move, I could think about
things, and what come into my head was that the man as had taken the second
floor front must be some unearthly creature, sprung from I won't mention where.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Do you really believe so?' whispered Devlin in my ear.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Believe what?' I asked, though my throat was that hot and
dry that I wondered how he could make out what I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'That I am an unearthly creature,' he said softly, 'sprung
from a place which shouldn't be mentioned to ears perlite?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I was petrified before, sir, you may guess how I felt when
I found out that he knew what I was thinking of.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You shouldn't be, you shouldn't be,' he whispered agin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Shouldn't be what?' I managed to git out, though the words
almost stuck to the roof of my mouth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Sorry you ever took me as a lodger,' he said with a grin.
'Fye, fye! It isn't grateful of you after sech a good reference as I give you.
Something 'll happen to you if you don't mind.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir, it was true I'd thought it, but I'll take my
solemn oath I never spoke it. It was jest as though that Devlin had my brains
spread open before him, and could see every thought as was passing through 'em.
I was so overcome that I as good as swooned away, and I believe I should have
gone off in a dead faint if he hadn't put something strong to my nose as made me
almost sneeze my head off. And while I was sneezing, there was Devlin and Lemon
laughing fit to burst theirselves. All the time he was dressing my hair that
sort of thing was going on; there wasn't a thought that come into my head that
he didn't tell me of the minute it was there, till he got me into that state
that I hardly knew whether I was asleep or awake. At last, sir, he finished me
up, and stepping back a little, he waved his hand and said to Lemon,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'There! what do you think of that?' meaning my hair.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Wonderful! Beautiful!' cried Lemon, clapping his hands and
jumping up and down in his chair, he was that egscited. 'I never saw nothing
like it in all my whole born days. It's a new style--quite a new style, and so
taking! The ladies 'll go wild over it. Where did you git it from?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'From a place,' said Devlin, grinning right in my face, 'as
shall be nameless.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'But you'll tell me some day, won't you?' cried Lemon.
'Because there might be other styles there as good as that, and we could make
our fortunes out of 'em.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'll take you there one day,' said Devlin, with an unearthly
laugh, 'and you shall see for yourself.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Do, do!' screamed Lemon. 'I'd give anything in the world to
go there with you!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Good Lord save him!' I thought, looking at Lemon whose eyes
was almost starting out of his head. 'He's going mad, he's going mad!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'As to making our fortunes,' Devlin went on, 'why not? It
shall be so.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It shall, it shall!' cried Lemon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We'll make hunderds, thousands,' said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We will, we will!' cried Lemon. 'Fanny shall ride in her own
kerridge.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Fanny shall,' said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'The Lord forbid,' I thought, 'that I should ever ride in a
kerridge bought at sech a price!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought more free now that Devlin's hands was not in my
hair; he didn't seem to be able to read what I was thinking of so long as we was
apart.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I bind myself to you,' said Devlin to my poor dear Lemon,
'and you bind yourself to me. The bargain's made. Your hand upon it.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lemon gave him his hand, and whether it was fancy or not, it
seemed to me that Devlin grew and grew till he almost touched the ceiling; and
that, while he was bending over Lemon and looking down on him, like one of them
vampires you've read of, sir. Lemon kep growing smaller and smaller till he was
no better than a bag of bones.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We go out to-morrer morning,' said Devlin, 'you and me
together, to look for a shop. Is it agreed?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It is,' answered Lemon, 'it is.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We will set London on fire,' said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We will, we will,' said Lemon; 'and we'll have shops all
over it.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You're a man of sperrit,' said Devlin. 'I kiss your hand.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He said that to me; but I clapped my hands behind my back.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'If you refuse,' said Devlin, smiling at me all the while, 'I
must show Lemon another style.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And he made as though he was about to dress my hair agin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, no!' I screamed; 'anything but that, anything but that!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I give him my hand, and he kissed it. His mouth was like
burning hot coals, and I wondered I wasn't scarred.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't forgit,' said Lemon, 'to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'll not forgit,' said Devlin. 'Till then, adoo.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The next minute he was gone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No sooner did he close the door behind him than I felt as if
tons weight had been lifted off me. I started up, and put my hands to my hair,
intending to pull it down.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What are you doing?' cried Lemon, starting up too, and
seizing hold of me. 'Don't touch it--don't touch it! I must study the style. I
never saw sech a thing in all my life. It's more than wonderful, its
stoopendous. You look like another woman. Jest take a sight of yerself in the
glass.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did take a sight of myself in the glass, and if you'll
believe me, sir, it seemed as if my head was covered with millions of little
serpents, curling and twisting all sorts of ways at once; and, as I looked at
'em moving, sir--which might have been or might not have been, but so it was to
me--I saw millions of eyes shining and glaring at me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'O, Lemon, Lemon!' I cried, bursting out into tears; 'what <i>
have</i> you done, what <i>have</i> you done?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Done?' said Lemon, rubbing his hands; he'd let mine go.
'Why, gone into partnership with the finest hairdresser as ever was seen. Our
fortune's made, Fanny, our fortune's made!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I tried to reason with him, but I might as well have spoke to
stone. He was that worked up that he wouldn't listen to a word I said. All the
satisfaction I could git out of him was--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'A good night's work, Fanny; a good night's work!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If he said it once he said it fifty times. But I knew it was
the worst night's work Lemon had ever done, and that it'd come to bad. And it
has, sir.&quot;</p>

<h5>FANNY LEMON RELATES HOW HER HUSBAND, AFTER BECOMING BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH
DEVLIN THE BARBER, SEEMED TO BE HAUNTED BY SHADOWS AND SPIRITS.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had my way about my hair before I went to bed. I waited
till Lemon was asleep, and then I brushed all the serpents out, and did it up in
a plain knot behind. I felt then like a Christian, and I said my prayers before
I stepped in between the sheets. I didn't sleep much; Lemon was that restless he
torsed and torsed the whole night long, and his eyes was quite bloodshot when he
got up. While he was dressing I heard Devlin call out:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon, I'm coming down to have breakfast with you.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Do,' cried Lemon. 'You're heartily welcome.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was down-stairs at the time--I always git up before Lemon,
to make the place straight and cook the breakfast--and I heard what passed.
Lemon, half-dressed, come running down to me, and told me to be sure to git
something nice for breakfast, and not to cut the rashers too thin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Go to the fish-shop,' he said, 'and git a haddick. We must
treat him well, Fanny, or he might cry off the bargain he made with me last
night.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought to myself I knew how I'd treat him if I had my way,
but it wouldn't have done jest then for me to go agin Lemon. There was times
when he said a thing that it had to be done, and that was one of 'em. So I goes
to the fishmonger's and gits a haddick, and I cooks three large rashers and six
eggs&mdash;three fried and three biled--and then Lemon and Devlin they come in
together as thick as thieves. Devlin had been telling Lemon something as had
made him laugh till his face was purple.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You never heard sech a man,' said Lemon to me. 'He's one in
a thousand.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'He's one in millions,' I thought, and I kep my head down for
fear Devlin should suspect what I was thinking of; 'and there's only one as ever <i>
I</i> heard of.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Devlin give me good morning and shook hands with me; I didn't
dare to refuse him. If he'd offered to kiss me, Lemon wouldn't have objected, I
believe, though there was a time when he was that jealous of me that a man
hardly dared to look at me. But those happy days was gone for ever.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I didn't have much appetite for breakfast, and no more had
Lemon, but Devlin made up for the pair of us. There was the haddick, and there
was the three rashers, and there was the six eggs. Devlin pretty well cleared
the lot. It was Lemon, I <i>must</i> say, who pushed him on to it, though it
didn't seem to me as he wanted much persuading. He had the appetite of a shark.
It didn't give me no pleasure to hear him praise my cooking and to hear him say
to Lemon that he'd got a treasure of a wife.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I have,' said Lemon; 'Fanny's a good sort.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When breakfast was over and everything cleared away Lemon
asked Devlin if he was ready, and Devlin said he was, and they went out arm in
arm jest as if they was brothers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They come home late, and Lemon was more excited than ever.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It's all settled, Fanny,' he said, 'I've taken another shop,
and Devlin and me's gone into partnership. We're going to work together, and
we'll astonish your weak nerves.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As if they hadn't been astonished enough already.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I asked Lemon where the shop was that he'd taken, but he
wouldn't tell me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It's a secret,' he said, 'between Devlin and me. What an
egstrordinary man he is, Fanny! What a glorious, glorious fellow! What a
fortunate thing that he saw the bill in our winder of a room to let, and that he
didn't go somewheres else! It's a providence, Fanny, that's what it is.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I wasn't to be put down so easy, and I tried my hardest to
git out of Lemon where the shop was, but he wouldn't let on.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I've promised Devlin,' he said, 'not to say a word about it
to a living soul. Perhaps we sha'n't keep it open long; perhaps we shall shut it
up after a month or two and take another; perhaps we shall do a lot of trade at
private houses. It's all as Devlin likes. I've give him the lead. There never
was sech a man.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was all I could git out of him. Devlin had him tight;
'twas nothing but Devlin this, and Devlin that, and Devlin t'other. Devlin was
as close as he was; I couldn't git nothing out of him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I love wimmin,' he said, 'but they must be kep in their
place. Eh, Lemon?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That was a nice thing for a wife to hear, wasn't it?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' said Lemon: 'you mind your business, Fanny, and we'll
mind our'n.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They went out the next morning together, and kep out late
agin; and so it went on for a matter of four or five weeks. Then there come a
change. From being in love with Devlin, Lemon begun to be frightened of him. I
saw it in his face every morning when they went away. Instead of Lemon's taking
Devlin's arm as he did at first, it was Devlin who used to take Lemon's arm,
jest above the elber jint, as much as to say:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I've got you, and I'm not going to let you escape me.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And instead of Lemon being brisk and lively and egscited of a
morning, as though he was going for an excursion in a pleasure van, he got
grumpy and dull, as though he was going to the lock-up to answer for some
dreadful thing he'd done. I spoke to him about it, but if he was close before,
he was a thousand times closer now.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't ask me nothing, Fanny,' he'd say; 'don't put questions
to me about <i>him</i>. I daren't say a word, I daren't, I daren't!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That didn't stop me; he was my husband, and if strange things
was being done, who had a better right than me to know all about 'em? But it was
all no use; I couldn't git nothing out of him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'If you don't shut up,' he said, quite savage like, 'I'll set
Devlin on to you, and you'll have cause to remember it to the last day of your
life!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Jest as if I haven't got cause to remember it! If I lived a
thousand years I couldn't forgit what's happened.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I could have got rid of my lodger I shouldn't have thought
twice about it; out he'd have gone; but he paid me reg'lar, did Devlin, and
always in advance, so that I had no egscuse for giving him notice. And even if I
had, I ain't at all sure that I should have had the courage to do it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It begun to trouble me more than I can say, that I never
heard him come in or go out, and that I never caught the sound of his footsteps
on the stairs or in the passage, and that, when he might have been in the Canary
Islands for all I knew, I'd turn my head and see him standing at the back of me,
without my having the least idea how he got into the room.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Here I am, you see, Mrs. Lemon,' he'd say; 'back agin, like
a bad penny. You're glad to see me, I'm sure. Say you're glad.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And I had to, whether I liked it or not. Then he'd grin and
wag his head at me, and sometimes say if he knew where there was another woman
like me he'd stick up to her. 'Lord have mercy,' I used to think, 'on the woman
who'd give you a second look unless she was obliged to!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I grew to be that shaky and trembly that my life was a
perfect misery; and so was Lemon's. But I used to speak about it, which was a
little relief, while poor Lemon would never so much as open his lips. I pitied
him a deal more than I did myself. I did say to him once:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon, let's call a broker in when Devlin's not here, and
sell the furniture, and run away.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You talk like a fool,' said Lemon. 'If we was to hide
ourselves in the bowels of the earth he'd ferret us out.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then Lemon said one night that Devlin was going to paint our
portraits.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'He sha'n't paint mine,' I cried, 'not if he orfered to frame
it in dymens!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The words was no sooner out of my lips than I turned almost
to a jelly at hearing Devlin's voice at the back of me, saying,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Nonsense, nonsense, Mrs. Lemon! Surely it ain't me you're
speaking of? Don't they paint all the Court beauties, and ain't you as good as
the best of them? Your face is like milk and roses, and I'm the artist that's
going to do justice to it. You can't refuse me; you won't have the heart to
refuse me.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which I hadn't, with him so close to me. He seemed to take
the backbone out of me; I used to feel quite limp when he took me up like that.
He <i>did</i> paint my picture, and there it is, stuck on the wall; and though
it's come over me a hunderd times to drag it down and burn it, it's more than I
dare do for fear of something dreadful happening.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can't describe what I went through while that picture was
being painted. There was I, setting like a stature in the position that Devlin
placed me; and there was Lemon, leaning for'ard, with his hands clarsping the
arms of his chair, and his eyes glaring like a ghost's; and there was Devlin,
waving his brush and painting me, making all sorts of strange remarks, and
singing all sorts of songs in all sorts of languages. He could do that, sir; I
don't believe there's a language in the world that he can't speak, and I don't
believe there's anything in the world, or out of it, for that matter, that he
doesn't know. &quot;<i>Now, where did he get it all from?</i></p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I used to wonder about his age. It was a regular puzzler.
Sometimes he looked quite young, and sometimes he looked as old as Methusalem. I
plucked up courage once to ask him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What do you say to twenty?' he answered. 'Or if that won't
do, what do you say to eighty, or a couple of hunderd?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When my portrait was finished he pretended to go into
egstacies over it, and said that it really ought to be egshibited.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Mind you keep it as a airloom,' he said. 'You've no notion
what it's worth.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then he took Lemon's picture, and it was a comfort to me that
he painted my husband up-stairs. Every night for a fortnight Lemon went up to
Devlin's room, and set there for two or three hours, and then he'd slide into
this room looking as if he'd jest come out of his corfin. It give me such a
shock when I first saw the picture that I threw my apern over my head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Ah,' said Devlin with a grin, pulling my apern away, 'I
thought you'd be overcome when you set eyes on it. It's a rare piece of work,
ain't it? Why, it almost speaks!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was as like Lemon as like could be--I couldn't deny that;
but there was the sly, wicked look which you've noticed in that there stuffed
bird and in the stone image on the mantelshelf. Devlin made us a present of them
things after he'd painted the portraits, and told me to treasure 'em for his
sake, and that whenever I looked at 'em I was to think of him. He said they was
worth ever so much money, but that I was never, never to part with 'em.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'If you do,' he said, laughing in my face, 'I'll haunt you
day and night.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So things went on, gitting worser and worser every day, and
Lemon got that thin that you could almost blow him away. And now, sir, I'm
coming to the most dreadful part of the whole affair, something that has
frightened me more than all the rest put together. What I'm going to speak of
now is that awful murder in Victoria Park. Don't think I'm making it up out of
my head. I ain't clever enough or wicked enough. If I was I should deserve a
judgment to fall on me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've told you of Lemon speaking in his sleep--never did he go
to bed without saying things in the night that'd send my heart into my mouth. He
seemed as if he was haunted by shadders and spirits, and as if there was always
something weighing on his soul that he daren't let out when he was awake. When I
found it was no good arguing with him I give it up, and I bore with his writhes
and groans, without telling him in the morning of the dreadful night I'd passed.
But the day before yesterday, sir, things come to a head.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He went out early with Devlin as usual, and they both come
home together a deal later than they was in the habit of doing. I fixed the time
in my dairy, sir; it was half-past eight o'clock. Before that I'd wrote my
letter to you and posted it--the letter you got yesterday morning. Little did I
dream of what was going to happen after I sent it off.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I noticed that Lemon was more trembly than ever, and there
was that in his eyes which made my heart bleed for him. It wasn't a wandering
look, because he was afraid to look behind him; it was as if he was trying to
shut out something horrible. But I didn't say a word to him while Devlin was
with us. He didn't remain long.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'm going to my room,' he said; 'I've got a lot of writing
to do. Bring me up a pot of tea before you go to bed. Lemon and me's been
spending a pleasant hour at the Twisted Cow.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon looks as if he'd been spending a pleasant hour,' I
thought, as I looked at his white face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then Devlin went to his room on the second floor, and I
breathed more free.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Twisted Cow, sir, is a public which Devlin is fond of.
You may be sure he'd pick out a house with a outlandish name.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'O, Lemon, Lemon,' I said, 'you look like a ghost!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Hush!' he said, with his hand to his ear; he was afraid
Devlin might be listening. 'Don't speak to me, Fanny; I want to be quiet, very
quiet. How horrible, how horrible!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What's horrible. Lemon?' I asked, putting my arms round his
neck.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He pushed me away and asked what I meant.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You said &quot;How horrible, how horrible!&quot; jest now, Lemon.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To my surprise, he answered 'I didn't. You must have fancied
it. Let me be quiet.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I didn't dispute with him, and we set here in the parlour for
more than an hour without saying a word to each other. Lemon hadn't been
drinking, sir; he was as sober as I am this minute.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I think I'll go to bed, Fanny,' he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The tears come into my eyes, he spoke so soft.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Shall I go and git your supper-beer, Lemon?' I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No,' he said, ketching hold of me. 'I won't be left alone in
the house with that--that devil up-stairs! I don't want no supper-beer.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was the first time he'd ever spoke of Devlin in that way,
and I knew that something out of the common must have happened. Perhaps they'd
quarrelled. O, how I hoped they had! It might put a end to their partnership,
and there would be a chance of peace and happiness once more.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I won't leave you. Lemon,' I said. 'I'll take that wretch
his tea, and I hope it'll choke him, and then I'll come to bed too. Shall I make
you some gruel, Lemon, or anything else you fancy?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No,' he answered. 'I don't want nothing--only to sleep, to
sleep!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I made the tea for Devlin, and it's a mercy I didn't have any
poison in the house, because I might have been tempted to put it in the
pot--though perhaps that wouldn't have hurt him. I knocked at his door, and he
said as pleasant as pleasant can be, 'Come in, Mrs. Lemon. What a treasure you
are! How happy Lemon ought to be with sech a wife!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But I didn't stop to talk to him. I put the tea on the table
and went down to Lemon. He was already in bed, and his head was covered with the
bedclothes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'll jest run down,' I whispered, 'and put up the chain on
the street-door. I won't be a minute. Lemon.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was back in less than that, and I went to bed. Lemon never
moved. I spoke to him, but he didn't answer me; and after a little while I went
to sleep.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I woke up as the clock struck twelve all in a prespiration.
Lemon was talking in his sleep, and this is what he said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Victoria Park. Eighteen years old. Golden hair. With a bunch
of daisies in her belt. A bunch of white daisies, with blood on 'em! With blood
on 'em! With blood on 'em! O Lord, have mercy on her! Near the water. Lord, have
mercy on her! Lord, have mercy on her!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And then, sir, he give a scream that curdled right through
me, and cried, 'Don't let him--don't let him! Save her--save her!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How would <i>you</i> feel, sir, if you heard some one laying
by your side saying sech things in the dead of night?&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_13" href="#div1Ref_13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h4>

<h5>IN WHICH FANNY NARRATES HOW HER HUSBAND HAD A FIT, AND WHAT THE DOCTOR
THOUGHT OF IT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing more took place before we got up in the morning.
Lemon torsed about as usual, and kept groaning and talking to hisself, but,
excep what I've told you, I couldn't make head or tail of his mumblings. Devlin
come down to breakfast, and said, as gay as gay can be,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I've had a lovely night.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Have you?' said I. I wouldn't have spoke if I could have
helped it, but he's got a way of forcing the words out of you.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' he answered, 'a most lovely night. I've slep the sleep
of the just.' What he meant by it I don't know, but it's what he said. 'You look
tired, Mrs. Lemon.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He grinned in my face, sir, as he made the remark, and my
blood begun to boil.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've got enough to make me look tired,' I said. 'Lemon hasn't
had a decent night's rest for months.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You don't say so! But why not, why not?' asked Devlin,
pitching into the ham and eggs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You can answer that better than I can,' I said, jumping from
the table; 'You; yes, you!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Fanny!' cried Lemon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I don't care,' I said, feeling reckless; I think it must
have been because I was sure you'd come to my help, sir. 'I don't care. Things
aren't as they should be, and it stands to reason they can't go on like this
much longer.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'O,' said Devlin, helping hisself to the last rasher. 'It
stands to reason, does it?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, it does,' I answered. 'I'm Lemon's wife, and if he
can't take care of hisself it's my duty to do it for him.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Can't you take care of yourself?' asked Devlin of my poor
husband. 'That's sad, very sad!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I can, I can,' cried Lemon. 'Fanny don't know what she's
talking about.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I thought as much,' said Devlin. 'Nerves unstrung. She wants
bracing up. I must prescribe for her.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Not if I know it,' I said. 'I've had enough of you and your
prescribing to last me a lifetime. Don't look at me like that, or you'll drive
me mad!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Was there ever sech an unreasonable woman?' said Devlin, and
he come and laid his hand upon me. 'Jest see how she's shaking. Lemon. She's
low, very low; I really must prescribe for her. Leave her to me. I'll see that
no harm comes to her.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What with his great staring eyes piercing me through and
through, and his hand patting my shoulder, and his mocking voice, and the grin
on his face, all my courage melted clean away, and I burst out crying and run
into the kitchen. There I stayed till I heard the street-door slam, and then I
went back to clear the breakfast-things, with a thankful heart that Devlin was
gone. If he'd only have left my husband behind him I should have been satisfied,
but Lemon was gone too. There was a bottle on the table with something in it,
and a label on it in Devlin's writing--</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For my dear kind friend, Mrs. Lemon. A tonic for her nerves.
A tablespoonful, in water, three times a day.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'A tablespoonful, in water, three times a day,' thinks I to
myself. 'Not if I know it.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was going to throw the bottle in the dusthole, but I
thought I'd better not, and I put it away on the top shelf of the cupboard,
right at the back. After that I went about my work, wondering how it was all
going to end, and casting about in my mind whether there was anything I could do
to get rid of the creature as was making our lives a misery. But I couldn't
think of nothing.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lemon was never very fond of politics, but he likes to know
what's going on, and we take in a penny weekly newspaper as gives all the news
from one end of the week to the other, and how they do it for the money beats me
holler. The boy brings it every Sunday morning, and it ain't once in a year that
Lemon buys a daily paper. You'll see presently why I mention it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was five o'clock in the afternoon, and I was setting
sewing when I hears the latchkey in the street-door. Now, Saturday is always a
late day with Lemon and Devlin; they don't generally come home till ten or
eleven o'clock at night, and I was surprised when I heard the key in the lock. I
knew it must be one or the other of 'em, because nobody but them and me has a
latchkey. I set and listened, wondering whether it was Lemon and what had
brought him home so early, and I made up my mind, if it <i>was</i> him, to have
a good talk with him, and try and persuade him once more to give up Devlin
altogether. 'But why don't he come in?' thought I. There he was in the street,
fumbling about with the key as though there was something wrong with it; and he
stayed there so long that I couldn't stand it no longer, so I goes to the door
and opens it myself. The minute it was open Lemon reels past me, behaving
hisself as if he was mad or drunk. I picked up the latchkey which he'd dropped,
and follered him into the parlour here. What made him ketch hold of me, and
moan, and cry, and look round as if he'd brought a ghost in with him, and it was
standing at his elber? And what made him suddingly cover his face with his
hands, and after trembling like a aspen leaf, tumble down on the floor in a fit
right before my very eyes? There he laid, sir, twisting and foaming, a sight I
pray I may never see agin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I knelt down quick and undid his neck-handkercher, and tried
to bring him to, but he got worse and worse, and all I could do wasn't a bit of
good.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was nobody in the house but Lemon and me, and, almost
distracted, I run like mad to the chemist's shop at the corner of the second
turning to the right, who's got a son walking the horspitals, and begged him to
come with me and see my poor man. He come at once, sir, and there was Lemon
still on the floor in his fit. The doctor unclarsped Lemon's hands and put
something in 'em, and I slipped a cold key down his back because his nose was
bleeding.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'That's a good sign,' said the doctor, as he forced Lemon's
jaws apart and put a spoon between his teeth, which Lemon almost bit in two.
Then he threw a jug of cold water into Lemon's face, completely satcherating
him, and after that Lemon wasn't so violent; but he didn't recover his senses or
open his eyes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Let's git him to bed,' said the doctor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He helped me carry Lemon up-stairs, where we undressed him,
and it wasn't before we got him between the sheets that he come to.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Feel better?' asked the doctor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But Lemon never spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't leave him,' said the doctor to me, and he went back to
his shop and brought a sleeping draught, which Lemon took, and soon afterwards
fell asleep.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'He won't wake,' said the doctor, 'for twelve hours at least.
Is he subject to fits?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, sir,' I answered; 'this is the first he's ever had. Can
you tell me what's the matter with him? He ain't been drinking, has he?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's no sign of drink,' said the doctor, 'and no smell of
it.
<i>Does</i> he drink?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Not more than is good for him,' I said. 'I've never seen
Lemon the worse for liquor.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What I don't like about him,' the doctor then said, 'was the
look in his eyes when he come to his senses--as if he'd had a shock. Has he
taken a religious turn?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, sir.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Is he sooperstitious at all?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, sir.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'The reason I ask, Mrs. Lemon,' said the doctor, 'is because
this don't seem to me a ordinary fit. Is there any madness in your husband's
family?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I never heard of any,' I answered, 'and I think I should
have been sure to know it if there was.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Very likely,' said the doctor, 'though sometimes they keep
it dark. All I can say is, there's something on Mr. Lemon's mind, or he's
received a mental shock.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;With that he went away.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lemon by that time was sound as a top. The doctor must have
given him a strong dose to overcome him so, and it did my heart good to see him
laying so peaceful. But I couldn't help thinking over what the doctor had said
of him. There was either something on Lemon's mind or he'd received a mental
shock. And that was said without the doctor knowing what I knew, for I'd kep my
troubles to myself. I didn't as much as whisper what Lemon had said in his sleep
the night before about the young girl in Victoria Park with golden hair and a
bunch of white daisies in her belt, covered with blood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Perhaps Lemon's been reading a story,' I thought, 'with
something like that in it, and it's took hold of him.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was nothing to wonder at in that. The penny newspaper
we take in always has a story in it that goes on from week to week, and always
ending at such a aggravating part that I can hardly wait to git the next number.
I fly for it the first thing Sunday morning, before I read anything else. Lemon
goes for the police-courts, and takes the story afterwards.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My mind was running on in that way as I picked up Lemon's
clothes, which the doctor and me had tore off him and throwed on the floor; and
I don't mind telling you, sir, that I felt in the pockets. First, his trousers.
There was nothing in 'em but a few coppers and two-and-six in silver. Then his
westcoat. There was nothing in that but his silver watch and a button that had
come off. Then his coat. What I found there was his handkercher, his spectacles,
and a evening newspaper, I folded his clothes tidy, and come down-stairs with
the paper in my hand. There must be something particular in it, thinks I, as I
set down in the parlour here, and opened it in the middle, and smoothed it out.
There was, sir.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The very first words I saw, in big letters, at the top of the
column was--'Dreadful and Mysterious Discovery in Victoria Park. Ruthless Murder
of a Young Girl. Stabbed to the Heart! A Bunch of Blood-stained Daisies!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you imagine my feelings, sir?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I could scarce believe my eyes. But there it was, staring me
in the face, like a great bill on the walls printed in red. The ink was black,
of course, but as I looked at the awful words they grew larger and larger, and
their colour seemed to change to the colour of blood.&quot;</p>

<h5>DEVLIN APPEARS SUDDENLY, AND HOLDS A CONVERSATION WITH FANNY ABOUT THE
MURDER.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now, sir, while I was looking in a state of daze at the
paper, and trying to pluck up courage to read it, I felt a chill down the small
of my back, and I knew that our lodger Devlin had crep into the room unbeknown,
without me hearing of him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What is this I've been told as I come along?' he said. 'My
friend Lemon, your worthy husband, taken ill? It is sad news. Is he very ill?
Let me see him.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What did I do, sir, but run out of the room, and up-stairs
where Lemon was sleeping, and whip out the key from the inside of the door and
put it in the outside, and turn the lock. Then I felt I could breathe, and I
went down-stairs to Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Why do you lock the poor man in?' he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'How do you know?' I said, 'that I have locked him in, unless
you've been spying me?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'How do I know what I know?' he said, laughing. 'Ah, if I
egsplained you might not understand. Perhaps there's little I don't know. I've
travelled the world over, Mrs. Lemon, and there's no saying what I've learnt. As
for spying, fye, fye, my dear landlady! But you must be satisfied, I suppose,
being a woman. Have you ever heard of second sight? It's a wonderful gift.
Perhaps I've got it; perhaps I can see with my eyes shut. Sech things are. But
this is trifling. Poor Lemon! I am really concerned for him. You musn't keep me
away from him. I'm a doctor, and can do him a power of good.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Not,' I said, and where I got the courage from in the state
I was in, goodness only knows, 'while there's breath in my body shall you doctor
my husband. Mischief enough you've done; you don't do no more.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Mischief, you foolish woman!' he said. 'What mischief? Have
you took leave of your senses?' But I didn't answer him. 'Ah, well,' he said,
shrugging his shoulders, 'let it be as you wish with my poor friend Lemon. I
yield always to a lady. What is this?' And he took up the newspaper. 'You've
been reading, I see, the particulars of this sad case. It is more than sad; it
is frightful.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I haven't read it,' I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'But you was going to?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I won't bemean myself by denying it,' I said. 'Yes, I was
going to, when you come into the room unbeknown and unbeware.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had it in my mind to say that it was a liberty to come into
a room as didn't belong to him without first knocking at the door, but his black
eyes was fixed on me and his moustache was curling up to his nose, and I didn't
dare to.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'When I come into the room,' he said, 'unbeknown and
unbeware, as you egspress it, you had no ears for anything. You was staring at
the paper, and your eyes was wild. What for? Is it a murder that frightens you?
Foolish, stupid, because murders are so common. How many people go to bed at
night and never rise from it agin, because of what happens while they sleep!
This murder is strange in a sort of way, but not clever--no, not clever. A young
girl, eighteen years of age, beautiful, very beautiful, with hair of gold and
eyes of blue, receives a letter. From her lover? Who shall say? That is yet to
be discovered in the future. &quot;Meet me,&quot; the letter says, &quot;in Victoria Park, at
the old spot&quot;--which proves, my dear landlady, that they have met before in the
same place--&quot;at eleven o'clock to-night.&quot; An imprudent hour for a girl so young;
but, then, what will not love dare? When you and Lemon was a-courting didn't you
meet him whenever he asked you at all sorts of out-of-the-way places? It is what
lovers do, without asking why. &quot;And wear,&quot; the letter goes on, &quot;in your belt a
bunch of white daisies, so that I may know it is you.&quot; Now, why that? It is the
request of a bungler. If the letter was wrote by her lover--and there is at
present no reason to suppose otherwise--he would recognise his sweetheart
without a bunch of white daisies in her belt. What, then, is the egsplanation?
That, also, is in the future to be discovered. Let us imagine something. Say
that between the young girl with the hair of gold and the eyes of blue and the
man that writes the letter there is a secret, the discovery of which will be bad
for him. Pardon, you wish to ask something?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' I said, 'about the letter. How do you know it was
wrote?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Did I say I know?' he answered, with his slyest, wickedest
look. 'Ain't we imagining, simply imagining? Being in the dark, we must find
some point to commence at, and nothing can be more natural than a letter.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Was it found in the young lady's pocket?' I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Nothing was found,' he answered, 'in the young lady's
pocket.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Then it ain't possible,' I said, 'that the letter could have
been wrote.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Sweet innocence!' said Devlin, and with all these dreadful
goings on, sir, that was making me tremble in my shoes, he had the impidence to
chuck me under the chin--and Lemon up-stairs in the state he was! 'What could be
easier than to empty a young lady's pockets when she's laying dead before you. A
job any fool could do. But the letter may be found.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And the murderer, too,' I said, with a shudder, 'and hanged,
I hope!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I share your hope,' he said, with one of his strange
laughs,' by the neck till he is dead. The more the merrier. To continue our
imaginings. Between the young lady and her lover, as I said, there's a secret as
would be bad for him if it was made public--as might, indeed, be the ruin of
him. This secret may be revealed in the correspondence as passed between them.
The chances are that those letters are not destroyed. Men are so indiscreet!
Why, they often forgit there's a to-morrer. The young lady is described as being
beautiful. More's the pity. Beauty's a snare. If ever I marry--which ain't
likely, Mrs. Lemon--I'll marry a fright. Beautiful as the young lady is, her
lover wishes to git rid of her. Perhaps he's tired of her; perhaps he's got
another fancy; perhaps he's seen her twin sister, and is smit with her. There's
any number of perhapses to fit the case. But the poor girl, having been brought
to shame----'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Is that in the paper?' I asked, interrupting him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No,' he answered, 'but it may be. It is always so with those
girls; there's hardly a pin to choose between 'em. Naturally, she won't consent
to let him get rid of her--won't consent to release him--won't consent to let
him go free. They quarrel, and make it up. They quarrel agin, and make it up
agin. Days, weeks go by, till yesterday comes, and she is to meet him at night.
She's got a mother, she's got a father; they set together, and she goes to bed
early. She's got a headache, she says, and so, &quot;Good-night, mother; good-night,
father;&quot; a kiss for each of 'em; and there's a end of kisses and good-nights.
The last page of her little book of life is reached. There's a lot in that scene
to make a body think--it's full of pictures of the past. Think of all the days
of childhood wasted; think of all the love, laughter, hopes, joys--wasted;
flowers, ribbons, fancies, dreams--wasted; all that good men say is sweetest in
life, and that's played its part for so many, many years--all wasted. Better to
have been wicked at once, better to have been sinful and deceitful all
through--think you not so? &quot;Good-night, mother; good-night, father,&quot; and so--to
bed? No. To go up to her little room and lock the door, to dress herself in her
best clothes, to make herself still more beautiful--for that, you see, may melt
her lover's heart--to put the bunch of white daisies in her belt, to wait till
the house is quiet--so quiet, so quiet!--and then to steal out softly, softly!
She stops at mother's door and listens. Not a sound. Mother and father sleep in
peace. Remembrances of the past come to her in the dark, and she cries a little,
very quietly. Then she departs. It is done. From that home she is gone for ever,
and she is walking to her grave! The park is still and quiet at that hour of the
night; excep for a few hungry wretches who prowl or sleep, the girl and the man
have it all to themselves. First--love passages. Twelve o'clock. They stop and
listen to the tolling of the bell--they all do that. Some smile and sing at the
chimes, some shiver and groan. Next--arguments, entreaties to be released. He
will be so good to her, O, so good, if she will only release him! One o'clock.
Next--more love-making and coaxing, then threats, passionate reproaches,
defiance. Ah, it has come to that--the end is near! Two o'clock. He stabs her,
quick and sudden, to the heart? Hark! do you hear the wild scream? Her body is
dead, and her soul--? But that and other mysteries remain to be
unravelled--which may be--Never!'&quot;</p>

<h5>FANNY DESCRIBES HOW SHE MADE UP HER MIND WHAT TO DO WITH LEMON.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;Devlin put down the newspaper, and waited for me to speak. I
think, sir, I've told you egsactly what he said, and as fur as possible in his
own words. They are so printed on my mind that I couldn't forgit 'em if I tried
ever so hard. As he described what had took place it was as if he was painting
pictures, and he made me see 'em. I saw the poor girl's home; I saw her setting
with her father and mother in jest sech a little room as this--for they are only
humble people, sir; I saw her kiss 'em good-night; I saw her in her bedroom
a-doing herself up before the looking-glass; I saw her put the bunch of white
daisies in her belt; I saw her steal out of the house to the park; I saw the man
and her walking about among the trees, and sometimes setting down to talk; I
heard a scream--another!--another!--and I covered my eyes with my hands to shut
it all out. I was so overcome that I hadn't strength to wrench myself away from
Devlin, who was smoothing my hair with his hands. But presently I managed to
scream:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't touch me! Don't touch me, you--you----'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You what?' asked Devlin in his false voice, moving a little
away from my chair.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My scream, and him speaking agin, brought me to myself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Never mind, never mind,' I said. 'If you know what I'm
thinking about, it's no use my telling you.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I do know,' he said. 'Why, it's wrote on your face. And I
know, too, that you want to ask me some questions. Fire away.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Mr. Devlin, I said, upon that, 'you slep at home last night,
didn't you?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Certainly, I did,' he answered. 'Don't you remember Lemon
and me coming in together?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' I said, 'I remember.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't you remember,' he said, 'that you brought me up a cup
of tea before you went to bed, and that I told you I had a lot of writing to do,
and that I said what a treasure you was, and how happy Lemon ought to be with
sech a wife?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes,' I said, 'I remember.' I couldn't say nothing else, it
was the truth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Inspired by the egsellent tea you make,' he went on, 'I
stopped up late and did my writing. If I mistake not, you put the chain on the
street-door before you went to bed.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, I did.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And when you went down this morning the chain was still up?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, it was.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And I breakfasted with you and Lemon?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, you did.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And I presume you made my bed some time during the day?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Of course I did.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Did it look as if it had been slep in?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'So that you see, my dear landlady,' he said, grinning at me,
'that it wasn't possible for me to have murdered the girl.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Who said you did it?' I asked, starting back, for he had
come close to me, and I thought he was going to touch me ag'in.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You didn't say so,' he said, 'but you thought so. It was
wrote in your face, as I told you a minute ago. It is women like you who would
put a man's life in danger, and think no more of it than snuffing a candle.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He didn't remain with me much longer, but went up to his
room. He was right in what he said he saw wrote in my face while he was
smoothing my hair; an idea had entered my head that it was him who had killed
the poor girl. I think him bad enough for anything; there's nothing wicked I
wouldn't believe of him. But of course it wasn't possible for him to have done
it; and I thought with thankfulness it wasn't possible for Lemon to have done
it, for he never stirred out of the house that night. It was what Lemon said in
his sleep that made me tremble and shiver. Why, sir, he spoke of the murder <i>
before it was done!</i> It says in the papers that when the poor girl was found
she had been dead hours, and the doctor fixes it that she must have been
murdered between two and three o'clock in the morning. And two hours and a half
before she was murdered Lemon was raving in his sleep and telling all about it!
How did he know, sir? how did he know?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it had been a ordinary case--if Lemon had only spoke in
his sleep about some murder or other, and I'd read the next day that a murder
<i>had</i> been committed that night, it would have been strange, but nothing so
very much out of the way. Our minds sometimes runs on dreadful things, enough to
give one the creeps, and we ain't accountable for everything we say when we're
asleep. But Lemon said Victoria Park, and it was done in Victoria Park. He said
eighteen years, and that was jest her age. He said golden hair, and she <i>had</i>
golden hair. He said a bunch of white daisies, and she wore a bunch of white
daisies. He said blood on 'em, and there <i>was</i> blood on 'em. He said
stabbed to the heart, and she <i>was</i> stabbed to the heart!</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll tell you, sir, what come to me, and made me feel almost
like a murderess. It was that if I'd really known what was going to happen when
I heard Lemon talking in his sleep, I might have saved the life of that poor
girl. But how was it possible for me to know? Still, that didn't prevent me
feeling like a guilty woman.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But how much did Lemon know? Did the wretch who killed the
girl tell him beforehand what he was going to do, and was Lemon wicked enough to
keep it to hisself? Was the murderer an acquaintance of Lemon's? If he was, I
made up my mind that a hour shouldn't pass after Lemon was awake this morning
before I put the police on the wretch's track. Lemon would know his name, and
where he lived, perhaps. Whatever was the consequences, I'd do what I could to
bring the monster into the dock.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was more than sorry that the doctor had give Lemon sech a
strong sleeping draught, and I prayed that he would wake up sooner than I
expected. I went to the bedroom, but there was Lemon fast asleep, with a face as
innocent as a babe unborn. He wasn't dreaming, he wasn't talking; his mind was
at rest as well as his body. You know more than I do, sir. Could anybody with
something dreadful on his mind have slep' like that? But my mind was made up.
The very minute Lemon was sensible, and knew what he was about, to the
police-station he should go with me, and make a clean breast of it.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>

<h5>Mr. LEMON WAKES UP.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was that impatient that I hardly knew what to do. Minutes
was like dymens, and there Lemon lay like a log. Couldn't I bring him to his
senses somehow or other? I tried. I walked about heavy. I threw down things. I
even turned Lemon over, but it had no more effect on him than water on a duck's
back. He never give so much as a murmur, and I don't think a earthquake would
have roused him. I had to give it up as a bad job, but I felt that it would be a
mockery for me to go to bed, because in the state I was in it wasn't likely I
could git a wink of sleep. Then I knew, too, that there wouldn't be a minute to
lose when Lemon opened his eyes, and that it was my duty to git everything
ready. So I spread out Lemon's clothes in regular order, not forgetting his
clean Sunday shirt, and I put on my bonnet and cloak, and set down and waited
all through that blessed night, looking at Lemon. I didn't hear a sound in the
room up-stairs, so I supposed that Devlin was asleep, and I thought how dreadful
it was to have a man like that in the house, a man as spoke of murder as though
he enjoyed it. The only sound that come to my ears two or three times in the
night was the policeman on his beat outside as he passed through the square, and
you may guess, sir, I didn't get any comfort out of that. I had my fancies, but
I shook 'em off, though they made me shake and shiver. One of 'em was that all
of a sudden, jest as the policeman had passed by, there rung through the square
shrieks of 'Murder! murder!' and millions of people seemed to be battering at
the street-door and crying that they'd tear Lemon and me to pieces. It didn't
seem as if they wanted to hurt Devlin, for there he was, standing and grinning
at us and the people, with that aggravating look on his face that makes me burn
to fly at him, if I only had the courage. Of course it was all fancy, sir; but
how would you like to pass sech a night?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At nine o'clock this morning, and not a minute before, Lemon
woke up. I had a cup of tea ready for him in the bedroom, and a slice of bread
and butter. He's gone off his breakfast for a long time past, and one slice of
bread and butter is as much as he can git down, if he can do that. Before I took
Devlin as a lodger, Lemon used to eat a big breakfast, never less than a couple
of rashers, and a couple of boiled eggs on the top of that, and four or five
slices of bread and butter cut thick. It is a bad sign when a man begins to say
he's got no appetite for breakfast. If his stomach ain't going all to pieces,
it's something worse, perhaps.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Why, Fanny,' said Lemon, seeing me with my bonnet on, 'have
you been out? What's the time?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He spoke quite calm and cheerful; the sleeping draught had
done him good, and had made him forgit.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'The time's nine o'clock, Lemon,' I answered, 'and I ain't
been out.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What's to-day?' he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Sunday,' I answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Sunday!' he exclaimed. 'It's funny. Everything seems mixed.
Sunday, is it? But, I say, Fanny, if you ain't been out, what have you got your
bonnet on for?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'm waiting for you,' I said. 'Git up, quick, you must come
with me at once.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Come with you at once,' he said, rubbing his eyes, to make
sure whether he was awake or asleep; and then he must have seen something in my
face, for he looked at me strange, and left off rubbing his eyes, and began to
rub his forehead. 'I can't understand it. Has anything gone wrong?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I said, speaking very solemn, and speaking as I
felt, 'you know too well what has gone wrong, and I only hope you may be
forgiven.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shouldn't have stopped short in the middle if it hadn't
been that we heard Devlin moving about in the room up-stairs. I looked up at the
ceiling, and so did Lemon, and when I saw his face grow white I knew that mine
was growing white as well; and I knew, too, that Lemon was gitting his memory
back.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Speak low, speak low,' he whispered. 'Devlin mustn't hear a
word we say. You hope I may be forgiven! For what? What have I done? O, my head,
my head! It feels as if it was going to burst!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His face begun to get flushed, and the veins swelled out. I
thought to myself, I must be careful with Lemon; I mustn't be too sudden with
him, or he'll have another fit. I was going to speak soothing, when he clapped
his hand on my mouth and almost stopped my breath.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Don't say nothing yet,' he said. 'You must tell me something
first that I want to know. I feel so confused--so confused! What's been the
matter with me? I don't remember going to bed last night.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You fell down in a fit, Lemon,' I said, 'and I had to get
the doctor to you.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Yes, yes,' he said eagerly. 'Go on--go on.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'We carried you up-stairs here, the doctor and me, and
undressed you and put you to bed; and when you come out of your fit he give you
a sleeping draught.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It's not that I want to know,' he said. 'What <i>made</i> me
go into a fit? I never had a fit before, as I remember. O Fanny, is it all a
dream?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I answered, 'you must ask your conscience; I can't
answer you. You come home with a evening paper in your pocket, a-moaning and
crying, and you ketches hold of me, and looks round as if a ghost had follered
you into the room, and then you falls down in your fit.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And him?' he said, pointing to the ceiling. 'Him--Devlin?
Was he with me? Did he see me while I was in the fit?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No,' I answered. 'He come home after we'd got you to bed,
and said he wanted to see you; but I wouldn't let him. I whipped up-stairs here,
and turned the key, so as he shouldn't git at you.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You did right, you did right. Was he angry?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'If he was, he didn't show it. He kep with me a long time,
talking about the--the----'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'About the what?' asked Lemon, the perspiration breaking out
on him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'About the murder! Well may you shiver! It was in the
newspaper you brought home with you, and he read it out loud, and talked about
it in a way as froze my blood.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Blood!' groaned Lemon, 'Blood! O Fanny, Fanny!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He is my husband, sir, and he was suffering, and I ain't
ashamed to say that I took him in my arms, and tried to comfort him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'One word, Lemon,' I said, 'only one word before we go on.
You ain't guilty, are you?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Guilty?' he answered, but speaking quite soft; we neither of
us raised our voices above a whisper 'My God, no! How could I be? Wasn't I at
home and abed when it was done? O, it's horrible! horrible! and I don't know
what to think.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Thank God, you're innocent!' I said, and I was so grateful
in my heart that my eyes brimmed over. 'And you didn't have nothing to do with
the planning of it? Tell me that.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, Fanny,' he said. '<i>Him</i> up-stairs there--did <i>he</i>
sleep at home last night?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Unless there's something going on too awful to think of,' I
said, 'he did. I ain't been in bed, Lemon, since home you come yesterday and had
your fit. And here in this room I've been setting with you from the time I put
the chain on the street-door last night till now. I've only left you once--to
take in the milk at seven o'clock this morning, and then the chain was on; it
hadn't been touched. No one went out of this house last night by the
street-door.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'They couldn't have gone out no other way,' said Lemon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I don't see how they could,' I said, though I had my
thoughts.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'And the night before, Fanny,' said Lemon, and now he looked
at me as if life and death was in my answer, 'the night it was done, did he
sleep at home then?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'To the best of my belief he did,' I said. 'You may put me on
the rack and tear me with red hot pinchers, and I can't say nothing but the
truth. He <i>did</i> sleep here the night that awful murder was done in Victoria
Park. Drag me to the witness-box and put me in irons, and I can't say nothing
else. I saw him go to his room after I'd put up the chain; he called out 'Good
night;' and the next morning the chain was up jest as I left it. You can't put
the chain on the street-door from the outside; it must be done from the in. And
now, Lemon, listen to me.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What do you want?' he groaned. 'O, what do you want? Ain't I
bad enough already that you try to make me worse?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I <i>must</i> say, Lemon, what is on my mind.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Won't it keep, Fanny?' he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It won't keep,' I answered. 'You know the man as committed
the murder, and you'll come with me to the police-station, and put the police on
his track.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'<i>Me</i> know the wretch!' Lemon cried, his eyes almost
starting out of his head. 'Have you gone mad?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'No, Lemon,' I answered, 'I'm in my sober senses. Whatever
happens afterwards, we've got to face the consequences, or we shall wake up in
the middle of the night and see that poor girl standing at our bedside pointing
her finger at us. It's no use trying to disguise it. I <i>know</i>
you know the wretch, and deny it you shan't.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'O,' he said, speaking very slow, as if he was choosing
words, 'you know I know him!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I do,' I answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Perhaps,' he said, with something like a click in his
throat, 'you will tell me how that's possible, when it's gospel truth I've never
set eyes on him all my born days.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I said, 'be careful, O, be careful, how you speak of
gospel truth! Remember Ananias! You may beat about the bush as much as you like,
but I'm determined to do what I've made up my mind to, and nothing shall drive
me from it.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Of course,' he said, upon that, and speaking flippant, 'if
you've made up your mind to the egstent you speak of, I'd best shut my mouth.
I'll keep it shut till you tell me how you know what you say you know.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I said, 'light you speak, but sech you don't feel.
You can't deceive me. When we was first married, you slep the sleep of
innocence, and your breathing was that regular as showed you had nothing on your
mind to take egsception to. But since that Devlin come into the house, the way
you've gone on of a night is simply awful. Jumping about in bed as you've been
doing night after night, and screaming and talking in your sleep----'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Talking in my sleep!' he cried, and I saw that I'd scared
him. 'You shouldn't have let me! Call yourself a wife? You should have stopped
me!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I couldn't help letting you, and I couldn't have stopped
you, Lemon, and I'm not sure whether it would have been right to do it if sech
was in my power.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'What have I said, what have I said?' he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'The night before last as ever was,' I said, 'when that
dreadful deed was done as was printed in the paper you brought home yesterday,
you said, while you was laying asleep on the very bed you're laying on now,
words as chilled my blood, and it's a mercy I'm alive to tell it. You spoke of
Victoria Park; you spoke of a beautiful young girl with hair the colour of gold;
you spoke--O, Lemon, Lemon!--you spoke of her being stabbed to the heart; you
spoke of a bunch of white daisies as she wore in her belt, and you said there
was blood on 'em----'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I had to stop myself, sir; for Lemon had hid his face in the
bedclothes, and was shaking like a man with Sam Witus's dance in his marrer. I
let him lay till he got over it a bit, and then he uncovered his face; it was as
white as a sheet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Fanny,' he said--and he was hardly able to get his words
out--'there's the Bible on the mantelshelf, there. Bring it to me.'&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_17" href="#div1Ref_17">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h4>

<h5>LEMON'S VISION IN THE TWISTED COW.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I fetched the Bible, sir, and he took it in his hand, and
swore a most solemn oath, and kissed the book on it, that he didn't know the
man, that he didn't know the girl, and that he had no more to do with the murder
than a babe unborn. Never in my life did I see a man in sech a state as he was.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'But, Lemon,' I said, 'how could you come to speak sech
words? How could you come to know all about the murder hours and hours before it
was done?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I'll tell you, Fanny,' he said, 'as fur as I know; and if
you was to cut me in a thousand pieces I couldn't tell you more.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'It ain't to be egspected,' I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'If there's men in the world,' Lemon went on, 'as can look
into the future, Devlin's one of 'em. If there's men in the world as can tell
you what's going to happen--without having anything to do with it theirselves,
mind--Devlin's one of 'em. The things he's told me of people is unbelievable,
but as true as true can be. &quot;Did you take particular notice of the gentleman
whose hair I've been jest cutting?&quot; he said to me. &quot;No,&quot; says I; &quot;why should I?&quot;
&quot;He's the great Mr. Danebury that all the world's talking of,&quot; says he. &quot;Is he?&quot;
says I. &quot;I wonder what brings him to our shop? What a charitable man he is!
&quot;What a good, good man he is!&quot; &quot;Good ain't the word for him,&quot; says Devlin. &quot;He
comes to our shop because it's out of the way. All the while I was operating on
him he was thinking of a little milliner's girl as he's got an appointment with
to-night. 'Pretty little Ph[oe]be!' he was saying to hisself as I was cutting
his hair. 'What eyes she's got! Bloo and swimming! What a skin's she's got! like
satting, it is so white and smooth! What lips she's got! She's a bit of spring,
jest budding. Pritty little Ph[oe]be--pretty little Ph[oe]be!'&quot; &quot;But what was he
saying that for?&quot; I asks. &quot;He can't be in love with her. He's a family man,
ain't he?&quot; &quot;I should think he was a family man,&quot; says Devlin. &quot;He's got the most
beautiful wife a man could wish for, and as good as she's beautiful; and he's
got half-a-dozen blooming children. But that don't prevent his being in love
with pritty little Ph[oe]be, and he's got an appointment with her to-night; and,
what's more, he's going to keep it.&quot; I'm putting a true case to you, Fanny,'
says Lemon, 'one of many sech. I fires up at what Devlin says about such a good
man--that is, I used to fire up when things first commenced. I don't dispute
with him now; I know it's no use, and that he's always right, and me always
wrong. But then I did, and I asks him how dare he talk like that of sech a man
as Mr. Danebury, as gives money to charities, and talks about being everybody's
friend. &quot;O, you don't believe me!&quot; Devlin says. &quot;Well, come with me to-night,
and we'll jest see for ourselves.&quot; And I go with him, and I see a pritty little
girl walking up and down the dark turning at the bottom of the Langham Hotel. Up
and down she walks, up and down, up and down. &quot;That must be her,&quot; says Devlin.
We keep watching a little way off on the other side of the way, where it's
darker still than where she's walking and waiting, and presently who should come
up to her but the great Mr. Danebury; and he takes her hand and holds it long,
and they stand talking, and he says something to make her laugh, and then he
tucks her arm in his, and walks off with her. &quot;What do you think of that?&quot;
Devlin asks. &quot;He's going to take her to a meeting of the missionary society.&quot;
What I think of it makes me melancholy, and makes me ask myself, &quot;Can sech
things be?&quot; At another time Devlin says, &quot;I shouldn't wonder if you heard of a
big fire to-morrer.&quot; &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; I asks. &quot;The man who's jest gone
out,&quot; Devlin answers, &quot;was thinking of one while I was shampooing him--that's
all.&quot; And that <i>was</i> all; but sure enough I do read of a big fire to-morrer
in a great place of business that's heavily insured, and there's lives lost and
dreadful scenes. And then sometimes when Devlin and me is setting together, he
gits up all of a sudden and stands over me, and what he does to me I couldn't
tell you if you was to burn me alive; but my senses seems to go, and I either
gits fancies, or Devlin puts 'em in my head; but when I come to there's Devlin
setting before me, and he says, &quot;I'll wager,&quot; says he, &quot;that I'll tell you what
you've been dreaming of.&quot; &quot;Have I been asleep?&quot; I asks. &quot;Sound,&quot; he answers,
&quot;and talking in your sleep.&quot; And he tells me something dreadful that I've said
about something that's going to happen; and before the week's out it does
happen, and I read of it in the papers. For a long time this has been going on
till I've got in that state that I'd as soon die as live. If you don't
understand what I'm trying to egsplain, Fanny,' said my poor Lemon, 'it ain't my
fault; it's as dark to me as it is to you. Sometimes I says to Devlin, &quot;I'll go
and warn the police.&quot; &quot;Do,&quot; says Devlin, &quot;and be took up as a accomplice, and be
follered about all your life like a thief or a murderer. Go and tell, and git
yourself hanged or clapped in a madhouse.&quot; Of course, I see the sense of that,
and I keep my mouth shut, but I get miserabler and miserabler. So the day before
yesterday--that's Friday, Fanny--Devlin and me is sitting in the private room of
the Twisted Cow, when he asks me whether I've ever been to Victoria Park, and I
answers &quot;Lots of times.&quot; Now Fanny,' said Lemon, breaking off in his awful
confession, 'if you ain't prepared to believe what's coming, I'll say no more.
It'll sound unbelievable, but I can't help that. Things has happened without me
having anything to do with 'em, and I'd need to be a sperrit instead of a man to
account for 'em.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'Lemon,' I said, 'I'm prepared to believe everything, only
don't keep nothing from me.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I won't,' said Lemon; 'I'll tell you as near and as straight
as I can what happened after Devlin asked me whether I'd ever been to Victoria
Park. His eyes was fixed upon me that strange that I felt my senses slipping
away from me; it wasn't that things went round so much as they seemed to fade
away and become nothing at all. Was I setting in the private room of the Twisted
Cow? I don't know. Was it day or night? I don't know. I wouldn't swear to it,
though the moon <i>was</i>
shining through the trees. The trees where? Why, in Victoria Park, and no place
else. And there was a man and a woman--a young beautiful woman, with golden
hair, and a bunch of white daisies in her belt--talking together. How do I know
that she's young and beautiful when I didn't see her face? That's one of the
things I'm unable to answer. And I don't see the man's face, either. Whether a
minute passed or a hour, before I heard a shriek, I can't say, and perhaps it
ain't material. And upon the shriek, there, near the water, laid the young girl,
dead, with the bunch of white daisies in her belt, stained with blood. Then,
everything disappeared, and, trembling and shaking to that degree that I felt as
if I must fall to pieces, I looked up and round, and found myself in the private
room of the Twisted Cow, with Devlin setting opposite me. &quot;Dreaming agin,
Lemon?&quot; he says, with a grin. But I don't answer him; my tongue sticks to the
roof of my mouth. That's all I know, Fanny. Whether I saw what I've told you, or
was told it, or only fancied it, is beyond me. What I've said is the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God!'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's what I heard from Lemon's own lips this morning, sir,
up-stairs, abed, where he is laying now, with the door locked on him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I took off my hat and cloak, and Lemon burst out crying.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'You believe me, Fanny!' he cried.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I believe every word you said,' I answered. 'It's no use
going to the police-station this morning. A good friend of our'n is coming to
see me to-day, and we'll wait and do what he advises us. Only you must promise
to see him.' And I told him who you was, and why I wrote to you on Friday before
poor Lizzie Melladew met her death.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;'I promise,' said Lemon, 'and you've done right, Fanny.'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now, sir, I've told you everything as I said I would, and
you know as much as I do about this dreadful business.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_18" href="#div1Ref_18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h4>

<h5>FANNY'S STORY BEING CONCLUDED, I PAY A VISIT TO MR. LEMON, AND RESOLVE TO
INTERVIEW DEVLIN THE BARBER.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">This was the story which Fanny related to me, and to which I
listened in wonder and amazement. As she related it I wondered at times whether
it was possible that what she said could be true, but I saw no reason to
question her veracity; and there certainly could be no doubt of her sincerity. I
had to some extent conquered the fascination which Lemon's portrait on the wall,
the stuffed bird in its glass case, and the evil-looking monster on the
mantelshelf had exercised over me, but even now I could scarcely gaze upon them
without a shudder. Fanny did not relate her story straight off, without a break,
and I need hardly say that it was much longer than is here transcribed. But I
have omitted no important point; everything pertinent to the tragedy of the
murder of Mr. Melladew's daughter is faithfully set down. When she finished it
was quite dark; at my request she had not lighted lamp or candle.</p>

<p class="normal">There were breaks, as I have said. Twice she left off, and
went up-stairs to see Lemon, and give him something to eat and drink.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He knows you're here, sir,&quot; she said, when she returned on
the first occasion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he impatient to see me?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied. &quot;All he seems to want is to be left
alone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But he will see me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, yes, sir! He'll keep his promise.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Once there was an interval of more than half-an-hour, during
which I ate some cold meat and bread she brought me, and drank a pint bottle of
stout.</p>

<p class="normal">There was another occasion when she suddenly paused, with her
finger at her lips.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you stopping for, Fanny?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Speak low, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Devlin!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where?&quot; I said, much startled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has just opened the street-door, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I heard nothing, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir, you wouldn't. You don't know his ways as I do. Don't
speak for a minute or two, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I waited, and strained my ears, but no footfall reached my
ears. Presently Fanny said:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He's gone up to his room. He waited outside Lemon's door, and
tried it, I think. Have you any notion what you are going to do about him, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My ideas are not yet formed, but I intend to see and speak
with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do, Fanny, A special providence has directed my steps here
to-day. I knew the poor girl who has been murdered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sir!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Her family and mine have been friends for years. The interest
I take in the discovery of the murderer is no common interest, and I intend to
bring him to justice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How, sir?&quot; exclaimed Fanny, greatly excited.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Through Mr. Devlin. The way will suggest itself. You have not
heard him leave the house since he entered a little while since?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir. He is in his room now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; I said, &quot;when I am with your husband--and I intend to
remain with him but a short time--Devlin comes down-stairs, let me know
immediately. Keep watch for him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, sir. O, how thankful I am that you're here--how
thankful, how thankful!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope we shall all have reason to be thankful. And now,
Fanny, I will go up to your husband.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll go in first, and prepare him, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us have lights in the house. Don't leave Mr. Lemon in the
dark. Put a candle in the passage also.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She followed my instructions, and then we went to her
husband's bedroom. I waited outside while she &quot;prepared&quot; him. It did not take
long to do so, and she came to the door and beckoned to me. I entered the room,
and desired her to leave us alone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But don't lock us in,&quot; I added.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir,&quot; she said. &quot;Lemon's safe now you're with him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With that she retired, first smoothing the bedclothes and the
pillow with a kind of pitying, soothing motion as though Lemon was about to
undergo an operation.</p>

<p class="normal">I moved the candle so that its light fell upon Lemon's face. A
scared, frightened face it was that turned towards me, the face of a man who had
received a deadly shock.</p>

<p class="normal">It is unnecessary to say more than a few words about what
passed between Mr. Lemon and myself. My purpose was to obtain from him
confirmation of the strange mysterious story which Fanny had related. In this
purpose I succeeded; it was correct in every particular. What I elicited from
Lemon was elicited in the form of questions which I put to him and which he
answered, sometimes readily, sometimes reluctantly. Had time not been so
precious, my curiosity would have impelled me to go into matters respecting
Devlin other than the murder of Lizzie Melladew, but I felt there was not a
minute to waste; and at the termination of my interview with Lemon I went into
the passage, where I found Fanny waiting for me. Whispering to her not to remain
there, in order that Devlin might not be too strongly prejudiced against
me--supposing him to be on the watch as well as ourselves--and receiving from
her instructions as to the position of his room, I mounted the stairs with a
firm, loud tread, and stood in the dark at the door which was to conduct me to
the presence of the mysterious being.</p>

<br>
<h4><a name="div1_19" href="#div1Ref_19">CHAPTER XIX.</a></h4>

<h5>FACE TO FACE WITH DEVLIN, I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION OF HIM.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">I rapped with my knuckles, and a voice which could have been
none other than the voice of Devlin immediately responded, calling to me to
enter. The next moment I stood face to face with the strange creature,
concerning whom my curiosity was raised to the highest pitch. He was sitting in
a chair upon my entrance, and he did not rise from it; therefore I looked down
upon him and he looked up at me. As my eyes rested on his face, I saw in it the
inspiration of the evil expression in the faces of Mr. Lemon's portrait, the
stone monster, and the bird's beak, which had made so profound an impression
upon me in the parlour on the ground-floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have been in the house some time,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have,&quot; I answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And have had a long, a very long, conversation with my worthy
landlady,&quot; he observed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About me,&quot; he said, not in the form of a question but as a
statement of fact.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Partly about you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And about poor Lemon?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, about him as well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sit down,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;I expected you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">There was only one other chair in the room besides the one he
occupied, and I accepted his invitation, and drew it up to the table. And there
we sat gazing at each other for what appeared to me a long time in silence.</p>

<p class="normal">The room was very poorly furnished. There were the two chairs,
a small deal table, and a single iron bedstead in the corner. Off the room was a
kind of closet, in which I supposed were a washstand and fittings. There was
only one other article in view in addition to those I have mentioned, and that
was a desk at which Devlin was writing.<a name="div4Ref_01" href="#div4_01"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
He did not put away his papers, and I was enabled to observe, without undue
prying, that his writing was very fine and very close.</p>

<p class="normal">How shall I describe him? A casual observation of his face and
figure would not suffice for the detection of anything uncanny about him, but it
must be remembered that I was abnormally excited, and most strangely interested
in him. He was tall and dark, his face was long and spare; his forehead was low;
his eyes were black, with an extraordinary brilliancy in them; his mouth was
large, and his lips thin. He wore a moustache, but no beard. In the order and
importance of the impressions they produced upon me I should place first, his
black eyes with their extraordinary brilliancy, and next, his hands, which were
unusually small and white. They were the hands of a lady of gentle culture
rather than those of a man in the class of life to which Devlin appeared to
belong. Not alone was his social standing presumably fixed by the fact of his
living in a room so poorly furnished at the top of a house so common as Mr.
Lemon's, but his clothes were a special indication. They were shabby and worn;
black frock-coat, black trousers and waistcoat, narrow black tie. Not a vestige
of colour about them, and no sign of jewellery of any kind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">I started. I had been so absorbed in my observance of him that
I, who should have been the first to plunge into the conversation, had remained
silent for a time so unreasonably long that the man upon whom I had intruded
might have justly taken offence.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; I said; &quot;did you not remark that you
expected me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;May I inquire upon what grounds your expectation was based?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He smiled; and here I observed, in the quality of this smile,
a characteristic of which Mrs. Lemon had given me no indication. Devlin was
evidently gifted with a touch of humour.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I reason by analogy,&quot; he said. &quot;My landlady has very few
visitors. You are here for the first time, with an object. You remain closeted
with her for hours. She probably sent for you. During the long interview
down-stairs you have been told a great deal about me. You hear me open the
street-door, and you know I am in the house. My landlady has a trouble on her
mind, and mixes me up with it. You have been made acquainted with this trouble
and with my supposed connection with it. Your curiosity has been aroused, and
you determine to seek an interview with me before you take your leave of her.
You come up uninvited, and here you are, as I expected. Am I logical?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite logical.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In a common-sense view of commonplace matters--and everything
in the world is commonplace--lies the ripest wisdom. Follow my example. Exercise
your common sense.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But I did not immediately speak. Devlin's words were so
different from what I had expected that I was for a moment at a loss. The
prospect of my being able to bring the murderer of Lizzie Melladew to justice
and of earning a thousand pounds did not appear so bright.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will assist you,&quot; he resumed; &quot;I will endeavour to set you
at your ease with me. Your scrutiny of me has been very searching; I ought to
feel flattered. What anticipations of my appearance you may have entertained
before you entered the room is your affair, not mine. How far they are realised
is your affair, not mine. But allow me to assure you, my dear sir,&quot; and here he
rose to his full height, and made me a half-humorous, half-mocking bow, &quot;that I
am a very ordinary person.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That cannot be,&quot; I said, &quot;after what I have heard.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the destiny,&quot; he said, resuming his seat, &quot;of greater
personages than myself to be ranked much higher than they deserve. Proceed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am here to speak to you about this murder,&quot; I said,
plunging boldly into the subject.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah, about a murder! But there are so many.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know to which one I refer. The murder of a young girl in
Victoria Park, which took place the night before last.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have heard and read of it,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You know also,&quot; I continued, &quot;that the tragedy has produced
in Mr. Lemon a condition of mind and body which may lead to dangerous results,
probably to a despairing death.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All men must die,&quot; he said cynically.</p>

<p class="normal">I was now thoroughly aroused. &quot;I have come to you for an
explanation,&quot; I said, &quot;and it must be a satisfactory one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You speak like an inquisitor,&quot; said Devlin, with a quiet
smile, and I seemed to detect in his altered manner a desire to irritate me and
to drive me into an excess of passion. For this reason I kept myself cool, and
simply said,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am resolved.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good. Keep resolved.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall do so. By some devilish and mysterious means you were
aware, before the poor girl left her home on Friday night, that her doom was
sealed. You could have prevented it, and you did not raise a hand to save her.
This knowledge I have gained from Mr. Lemon, to whom, through you, the impending
tragedy was known.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then why did <i>he</i> not prevent it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was not in his power. He was not acquainted with the names
of the murderer and his victim.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was I?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must have been. I do not pretend to an understanding of
the extraordinary power you exercise, but I am convinced that, in connection
with you, there is a mystery which should be brought to light, and if I can be
the agent to unmask you I am ready for the work. With all the earnestness of my
soul, I swear it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A low laugh escaped Devlin's lips. &quot;Were a commissioner of
lunacy here,&quot; he said, &quot;you would be in peril. This young girl you speak of, is
she in any way connected with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;She was my friend; I knew her from childhood; she has sat at
my table with her sister and parents, and I and mine have sat at theirs. Her
family are plunged into the lowest depths of despair by the cruel, remorseless
blow which has fallen upon them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And you have taken upon yourself the task of an avenger. It
is chivalrous, but is it entirely unselfish? I am always suspicious of mere
words; there is ever behind them a secret motive, hidden by a dark curtain. I
speak in metaphor, but you will seize my meaning, for you are a man of nerve and
intelligence, utterly unlike our friend in the room below, whose nature is
servile and abject, and who is not, as you are, given to heroics. Calm yourself.
I am ready to discuss this matter with you, but in your present condition I
should have the advantage of you. You are heated; I am cool and collected. You
have some self-interest at heart; I have none. Your words are so wild that any
person but myself hearing them would take you for a madman. For your own
sake--not for mine, for the affair does not concern me--I advise moderation of
language. I suppose you will scarcely believe that the man upon whom you have
unceremoniously intruded, and against whom you launch accusations, the very
extravagance of which renders them unworthy of serious consideration--you will
scarcely believe that this man is simply a poor barber who has not a second coat
to his back, nor a second pair of shoes to his feet. But it is a fact--a proof
of the injustice of the world, ever blind to merit. For I am not only a barber,
sir, I am a capable workman, as I will convince you. Pray do not move; a cooling
essence and a brush skilfully used effect wonders on an over-heated head.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was not in my power to resist him. He had taken his place
behind my chair, and before he had finished speaking had sprinkled a liquid over
my head which was so overpoweringly refreshing that I insensibly yielded to its
influence. With brush and comb he arranged my hair, his small white hands
occasionally touching my forehead gently and persuasively. When I thought
afterwards of this strange incident I called to mind that, for the two or three
minutes during which he was engaged in the exercise of his art, I was in a kind
of quiet dream, in which all the agitating occurrences of the previous day in
connection with the murder of Lizzie Melladew were mentally repeated in proper
sequence, closing with Mr. Portland's offer of a thousand pounds for the
discovery of the murderer. It was, as it were, a kind of panorama which passed
before me of all that occurred between morning and night. I looked up,
inexpressibly refreshed, and with my mind bright and clear. Devlin stood before
me, smiling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Confess, sir,&quot; he said, in a soft persuasive tone, &quot;that I
have returned good for evil. The fever of the brain is abated, or I am a bungler
indeed. We will now discuss the matter.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_20" href="#div1Ref_20">CHAPTER XX.</a></h4>

<h5>DEVLIN ASTONISHES ME.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;I remarked to you just now,&quot; he said, seating himself
comfortably in his chair, &quot;that I am always suspicious of mere words, for the
reason that there is ever a secret motive behind them. From what you have said I
should be justified in supposing that your desire to discover the mystery in
which the death of your poor young friend is involved springs simply from
sympathy with her bereaved family. I will not set a trap for you, and pin you to
that statement by asking questions which you would answer only in one way. You
would argue with yourself probably as to the disingenuousness of those answers,
but would finally appease your conscience by deciding that I, a perfect stranger
to you and your affairs, cannot possibly have anything to do with the private
motives by which you are influenced. Say, for instance, by such a motive as the
earning of a reward which we will put down at a thousand pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For the life of me I could not restrain a start of
astonishment. It was the exact sum Mr. Portland had offered me. By what dark
means had Devlin divined it?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You need not be discomposed,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;The thing is
natural enough. You have credited me with so much that it will harm neither of
us if you credit me with a little more--say, with a certain faculty for reading
men's thoughts. The world knows very little as yet; it has much to learn; and I,
in my humble way, may be a master in a new species of spiritual power. Now, I
have a profound belief in Fate; what it wills must inevitably be. And, impressed
by this article of faith, I, the master, may be willing to become the slave.
Fate has led you to this house, and it may be that you are an instrument in
discoveries yet to be made. I continue, you observe, to speak occasionally in
metaphor. Be as frank with me as I have been with you. No, don't trouble
yourself to speak immediately. In the words you were about to utter there is a
subterfuge; you have not yet made up your mind to be entirely open with me. You
and I meet now for the first time. Before this day I have never known of your
existence, nor have you been aware of mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If that be true,&quot; I said, interrupting him, &quot;what made you
mention the reward of a specific sum?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of a thousand pounds?&quot; he asked, smiling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Exactly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you deny that such a reward has been offered to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not deny it; but by what mysterious means did you come
to the knowledge of it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because it is in your mind, my dear sir,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is no answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is it not? I should have thought it would satisfy you, but
you are inclined to be unreasonable. Come, now, I will show you how little I am
concealing from you with respect to my knowledge of your movements.&quot; He shaded
his eyes with his hand, and looked at me from beneath it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know your name, nor in what part of London you
reside, but certainly you and your wife--no doubt a most estimable lady--were
sitting together at breakfast yesterday morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He paused, and waited for me to speak. &quot;It is quite true,&quot; I
said; &quot;but there is nothing unusual in husband and wife partaking of that meal
in company.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing in the least unusual if a man is master of his own
time, as you were yesterday morning, for the first time for a long while past.
The fact is, you had lost a situation in which you have been employed for
years.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I sat spellbound. Devlin continued:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The breakfast-things are on the table, and you and your lady
are discussing ways and means. You are not rich, and you look forward with some
fear to the future. Times are hard, and situations are not easy to obtain. In
the midst of your consultation a man rushes into the room. He is a middle-aged
man. Shall I describe him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you can,&quot; I said, my wonder growing.</p>

<p class="normal">He gave me a fairly faithful description of Mr. Melladew, and
proceeded:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A great grief has fallen upon this man. It is only within the
last hour that he has discovered that his daughter had been murdered. He remains
with you some time, and then other persons make their appearance, among them
newspaper reporters and policemen, all doubtless drawn to your house by this
business of the murder. You have also an interview with a young gentleman. The
day passes. It is evening, and you are seated with another person. By this
person you are offered one thousand pounds if you discover the murderer of the
young girl, and another thousand if you find her sister, who has strangely
disappeared. I do not wish to deprive you of such credit as belongs to a man who
sympathises with a friend in trouble; but it is certainly a fact that the dim
prospect of earning such a handsome sum of money is very strong within you. That
is all.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I deliberated awhile in silence, and Devlin did not disturb my
musings. All that he had narrated had passed through my mind while he was
engaged in dressing my hair. Had he the power of reading thoughts by the mere
action of his fingers upon a man's head? No other solution occurred to me, and
had I not been placed in my present position I should instantly have rejected
it; but now I was in the mood for entertaining it, wild and incredible as it
appeared. During this interval of silence I made a strong endeavour to calm
myself for what was yet to take place between me and Devlin, and I was
successful. When I spoke I was more composed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You say you do not know where I live. Is it true?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite true,&quot; he answered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You do not really know my name?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor the names of my visitors?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor the names of your visitors.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you must be aware,&quot; I said, &quot;admitting, for the sake of
argument, that you are not romancing----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, laughing, &quot;admitting that, for the sake of
argument.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must be aware that the name of the first man who visited
me--he being, as you have declared, the father of the murdered girl--is
Melladew.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am aware of it, not from actual knowledge, but from what I
have read in the newspapers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But of the name of the gentleman who, you say, offers the
reward of a thousand pounds, you are ignorant.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite ignorant. Now, having replied to your questions
frankly, confess that you have forced yourself upon me with a distinct motive,
in which I, a stranger to you, am interested.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My object is to discover the murderer and bring him to
justice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A very estimable design.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And also to discover what has become of the murdered girl's
sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Exactly. How do you propose to accomplish your object?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Through you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed! Through me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As surely as we are in the same room together, through you.
Receive what I am about to say as the fixed resolve of a man who sees before him
a stern duty and will not flinch from it. Having come into association with you,
I am determined not to lose sight of you. I put aside any further consideration
of a strange and inexplicable mystery in connection with yourself as being
utterly and entirely beyond my power to understand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Devlin, with a glance at his shabby
clothes, &quot;you flatter me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All my energies now are bent to one purpose, which, through
you, I shall carry to its certain end. You have made yourself plain to me. I
hope up to this point I have made myself plain to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are the soul of lucidity,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;but much remains
yet to explain. For the sake of argument we have admitted an element of romance
into this very prosaic matter; for it is really prosaic, almost commonplace.
Life is largely made up of tragedies and mysteries, the majority of them petty
and contemptible, a few only deserving to be called grand. As a matter of fact,
my dear sir, existence, with all its worries, anxieties, hopes, and
disappointments, is nothing better than a game of pins and needles. It is the
littleness of human nature that magnifies a pin prick into a wound of serious
importance. To think that some of these mortals should call themselves
philosophers! It is laughable. Do you follow me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not entirely,&quot; I replied, &quot;but I have some small glimmering
of your meaning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were your mind,&quot; said Devlin, shaking with internal laughter,
&quot;quite free from the influence of that thousand pounds, it would be clearer. In
the grand Scheme of Nature, so far as mortals comprehend it, the potent screw is
human selfishness. These speculations, however, are perhaps foreign to the
point. Let us continue our amicable argument until we thoroughly understand each
other upon the subject of this murder. You see, my dear sir, I wish to know
exactly how I stand; for despite the extraordinary opinion you have formed of
me, it is you who have assumed the <i>rle</i> of Controller of Destinies. I am
but a mere instrument in your hands.&quot; He measured me with his eyes. &quot;You are
well built, and are, I should judge, a powerful man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are contemplating the probability of a physical struggle
between us,&quot; I said. &quot;Dismiss it; there will be none.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He made me a mocking bow. &quot;My mind is, indeed, relieved. You
do not intend violence, then. I am free to leave the house if I wish--at this
moment, if I please. Have you taken that contingency into account?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will not attempt to detain me by force?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In such an event, how will you act?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall follow you, and to the first policeman I meet I shall
say, 'Arrest that person. He is implicated in the murder of Lizzie Melladew.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin cast upon me a look of admiration. &quot;That would be
awkward,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Decidedly awkward--for you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You would be asked to furnish evidence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Direct evidence it would be, at present, out of my power to
supply,&quot; I said; I was on my mettle; my mental forces were never clearer, were
never more resolutely set upon one object; &quot;but there is such a thing as
circumstantial evidence. Mr. Lemon and his wife should come forward, and relate
all that they know concerning you. You and Mr. Lemon are carrying on a business
somewhere; the place should be searched; it should be made food for the
multitude who are ever on the hunt for the sensational. Your desk on the table
here contains writings of yours; they may throw light upon the investigation. So
we should go on, step by step, independent of your assistance, until we get the
murderer--who may or may not be an accomplice of yours--into the clutches of the
law.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Towards the end of this speech I had risen and approached the
window, which faced the square. Mechanically lifting the blind, I looked out,
and saw what arrested my attention. By the railings on the opposite side, with
his eyes raised to the window, was the figure of a man. He was standing quite
motionless, and, the night being fine, with a panoply of stars in the sky, I
presently recognised the figure to be that of George Carton, poor Lizzie
Melladew's distracted lover. At some little distance from him was the figure of
another man, whose movements were distinguished by restlessness, and in him I
recognised Carton's guardian, Mr. Kenneth Dowsett.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Looking for a policeman?&quot; inquired Devlin, with a touch of
amusement in his voice.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; I replied, &quot;but I am pleased to discover that I am not
alone, that I have friends outside ready to assist me the moment I call upon
them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin rose, and joined me at the window.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is your sight very keen?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Keen enough to recognise friends,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mine is wonderful,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;quite catlike; another of
my abnormal qualities. I can plainly distinguish the features of the two men
upon whom we are gazing. One is young. Who is he?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His name,&quot; I replied, believing that entire frankness would
be more likely to win Devlin to my side, &quot;is George Carton.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I recognise him; he was in your house yesterday morning. He
seems distressed. There is a troubled look in his face.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was the murdered girl's lover.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah! And the other, the elder man, casting anxious glances
upon the younger--who may he be?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;His name is Mr. Kenneth Dowsett. He is young Carton's
guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you,&quot; said Devlin, returning to his seat at the table.
I dropped the blind, and resumed my seat opposite to him, and then I observed a
singular smile upon his face, to which I could attach no meaning.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I presented,&quot; he said, &quot;a certain contingency to you, the
contingency of my leaving this house, and you have been delightfully explicit as
to the course you would pursue. But, my dear sir, crediting myself with a
species of occult power, which you appear ready to grant to me, might it not be
in my power to vanish, to disappear from your sight the moment the policeman you
would summons attempted to lay hands upon me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must chance that,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good. Nothing of the sort will occur, I promise. I cannot
carry on my pursuit as a Shadow. The idea of leaving the house did occur to me;
I banish it. Well, then, suppose I remain here; suppose I put an end to this
discussion; suppose I go to bed. To all your vapourings, suppose I say, 'Go to
the devil!' Why on earth do you stare at me so? It is a common saying, and the
awful consequences of such a journey are seldom thought of. I repeat, I say to
you, 'Go to the devil!' What, then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I still could summon a policeman,&quot; I said; &quot;but even if I
postponed that step or you managed to escape from me, I have a talent which, now
that it occurs to me, I shall immediately press into my service.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Enlighten me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I took from my pocket some letters, and tore from them three
blank leaves, upon which I set to work with pencil. My task occupied me ten
minutes and more, during which time Devlin, sitting back in his chair, watched
me with an expression of intense amusement in his face. When I had finished I
handed him one of the blank leaves.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My portrait!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;I am an artist myself, as you
have seen in Mrs. Lemon's parlour. This picture is the very image of me!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is no mistaking it,&quot; I said complacently. &quot;It will
insure recognition.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In what way do you propose to turn it to advantage, in the
event of my being contumacious?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have doubtless,&quot; I said, &quot;noted the changes that have
taken place in the life of civilised cities?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Excellent,&quot; he said. &quot;My dear sir, you compel my admiration;
you are altogether so different a person from the simpleton who lies shaking in
his bed on the floor below. You have brain power. My worthy landlord and partner
would have as well fulfilled his destiny had he been a mouse. The changes that
have taken place! Ah, what changes have I not seen, say, in the course of the
last thousand years!&quot; And here he laughed loud and long. &quot;But proceed, my dear
sir, proceed. How do these changes affect me in the matter we are now
considering?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was a time----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Really, like the beginning of a fairy story,&quot; he interposed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When public opinion was of small weight, whereas now it is
the most important factor in social affairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Lucidly put. I listen to you with interest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The penny newspaper,&quot; I observed sagely, &quot;is a mighty
engine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You speak with the wisdom of a platitudinarian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It enlists itself in the cause of justice, and frequently
plays, to a serviceable end, the part of a detective. You may remember the case
of Leroy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A poor bungler, a very poor bungler. A small mind, my dear
sir, eaten up by self-conceit of the lowest and meanest quality.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For a long time Leroy evaded justice, but at length he was
arrested. A popular newspaper published in its columns a portrait of the
wretch----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I see,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;and you would publish my portrait in
the newspapers?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In every paper that would give it admittance; and few would
refuse. Beneath it should be words to the effect that it was the portrait of a
man who knew, before its committal, that the murder of the poor girl Lizzie
Melladew was planned, and who must, therefore, be implicated in it. The portrait
would lead to your arrest, and then Mr. and Mrs. Lemon would come forward with
certain facts. Mr. Devlin, I would make London too hot to hold you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An expressive phrase. Your plan is more than ordinarily
clever; it is ingenious. And London,&quot; said Devlin thoughtfully, &quot;is such a place
to work in, such a place to live in, such a place to observe in! To be banished
from it would be a great misfortune. What other city in the world is so full of
devilment and crime; what other city in the world is so full of revelations;
what other city in the world is so full of opportunities, so full of contrasts,
so full of hypocrisy and frivolity, so full of cold-blooded villainy? The
gutters, with their ripening harvests of vice for gaol find gallows; the
perfumed gardens, the fevered courts; the river, with its burden of jewels and
beauty, with its burden of woe and despair; the bridges, with their nightly load
of hunger, sin, and shame; the mansions, with their music, and false smiles, and
aching hearts; the garrets, with their dim lights flickering; the bells, with
their solemn warning; the busy streets, with their scheming life; the smug
faces, the pinched bellies, the satins, the rags, the social treacheries, the
suicides, the secret crimes, the rotting souls! My dear sir, the prospect of
your making such a field too hot to hold even such a poor tatter-demalion as
myself overwhelms me. What is the alternative?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That you pledge yourself by all that is holy and sacred to
give me your fullest assistance towards the discovery of Lizzie Melladew's
murderer.&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_21" href="#div1Ref_21">CHAPTER XXI.</a></h4>

<h5>DEVLIN AND I MAKE A COMPACT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;A sacred and holy pledge,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;from me? Is it
possible that you ask <i>me</i> to bind myself to you by a pledge that you deem
holy and sacred?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I know of no other way to secure your assistance,&quot; I said,
feeling the weight of the sneer.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you did, you would adopt it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Assuredly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that, after all, you are to a certain extent in my power.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;As you to a certain extent are in mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A fair retort. Before I point out to you how illogical and
inconsistent you are, let me thank you for having converted what promised to be
a dull evening into a veritable entertainment. It is a real cause for gratitude
in such a house as Lemon's, of whom I have already spoken disparagingly, but of
whom I cannot speak disparagingly enough. My dear sir, that person is devoid of
colour, his moral and physical qualities are feeble, his intellect may be said
to be washed out. It is the bold, the daring, that recommends itself to me,
although I admit that there are curious studies to be found among the meanest of
mortals. Now, my dear sir, for your inconsistency and your lack of the logical
quality. My worthy landlady has conveyed to you an impression of me which, to
describe it truthfully, may be designated unearthly. How much farther it goes I
will not inquire. Her small capacity has instilled into what, as a compliment, I
will call her mind, a belief that I am not exactly human--in point of fact, that
if I am not the Evil One himself, I am at least one of his satellites. Common
people are inclined to such extravagances. They believe in apparitions,
vampires, and supernatural signs, or, to speak more correctly, in signs which
they believe to be supernatural. The most ordinary coincidences--and think, my
dear sir, that there are myriads of circumstances, of more or less importance,
occurring every twenty-four hours in this motley world, and that it is a
mathematical certainty that a certain proportion of these myriads should be
coeval and should bear some relation to each other--the most ordinary
coincidences, I repeat, are outrageously magnified by their imaginations when,
say, sickness or death is concerned. A woman wakes up in the night, and in the
darkness hears a ticking--tick, tick, tick! She rises in the morning, and hears
that her mother-in-law has died during the night. 'Bless my soul!' she exclaims.
'I knew it, I knew it! Last night I woke up all of a tremble'--(which, she did
not, but that is a detail)--'and heard the death-tick!' The story, being told to
the neighbours, invests this woman, who is proud of having received a
supernatural warning, with supreme importance. She becomes for a time a social
star. She relates the story again and again, and each time adds something which
her imagination supplies, until, in the end, it is settled that her
mother-in-law died at the precise moment she woke up; that she saw the ghost of
that person at her bedside, very ghastly and sulphury, in the moonlight--(it is
always moonlight on these occasions)--that the ghost whispered in sepulchral
tones, 'I am dying, good-bye;' that there was a long wail; and that then she
jumped out of bed and screamed, 'My mother-in-law is dead!' This is the story
after it has grown. What are the facts? The woman has eaten a heavy supper, and
she sleeps not so well as usual; she wakes up in the middle of the night. In the
kitchen a mouse creeps on to the dresser, after some crumbs of bread and cheese
which are in a plate. The ever-watchful cat--I love cats, especially good
mousers--jumps upon the dresser, with the intention of making a meal of the
mouse. On the dresser, then, at this precise moment, are the plate containing
the crumbs of bread and cheese, the mouse, and the cat. There are other things
there, of course, but there is only one other thing connected with the story,
and that is a jug half-full of water. The cat, jumping after the mouse,
overturns this jug, and the water flows till it reaches the edge of the dresser,
whence it drips, drips, drips, upon the floor. This is the tick, tick, tick
which the woman up-stairs hears--the death-tick of her mother-in-law! Her
mother-in-law is eighty-seven years of age, and has been ill for months; her
death is daily expected. She dies on this night, and the story is complete. A
dying old woman, eighty-seven years of age, her daughter-in-law who has eaten
too much supper, a plate of crumbs, a jug with water in it, a cat, and a mouse.
Of these simple materials is a message from the unseen world created, which
enthrals the entire neighbourhood. Analyse the miracles handed down from ancient
times, some of which are woven into the religious beliefs of the people, and you
will find that they are composed of parts as common and vulgar.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I made no attempt to interrupt Devlin in his narration of this
commonplace story. He had, when he chose to exercise it, a singularly
fascinating manner, and his voice was melodious, and when he paused I felt as if
I had been listening to an attractive romance. While he spoke, his fingers were
playing with a penholder and a pencil which were on the table; the penholder was
long, the pencil was short, and I observed that he had placed one upon the other
in the form of a cross.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am dull, perhaps,&quot; I said, &quot;but I do not see how your story
proves me to be illogical and inconsistent.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I related it,&quot; replied Devlin, looking at the cross, &quot;simply
to show how willing people are to believe in the supernatural. My worthy
landlady believes that I am a supernatural being; her husband believes it; <i>
you</i> are inclined to lend a ready ear to it. And yet you tell me that you
will be satisfied with a sacred and holy pledge from me, knowing, if you are at
all correct in your estimate of me, that such a pledge is of as much weight and
value as a soap bubble. How easy for me to give you this pledge! And all the
while I may be a direct accessory in the tragedy you have resolved to unriddle.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thank you for reminding me,&quot; I said. &quot;You shall swear to me
that you have had no hand in this most horrible and dastardly murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;More inconsistency, more lack of logical perception,&quot; he
said, and the magnetism in his eyes compelled me to fix my gaze upon the cross
on the table. &quot;You ask me to swear, and you will be content with my oath. I
render you my obligations for your faith in my veracity. How shall I swear? How
shall I deliver myself of the sacred and holy pledge? There are so many forms,
so many symbols, of pledging one's mortal heart and immortal soul. The civilised
Jew, when he is married to his beloved under the canopy, grinds a wine glass to
dust with the heel of his boot, and the guests and relatives, especially the
relatives of the bride, lift up their voices in joyful praise, with the
conscious self-delusion that this sacred rite insures the faithfulness of the
bridegroom to the woman he has wedded. Some burn wax candles--very bad wax
often--for the release of souls from purgatory. The Chinaman, called upon for
his oath, blows out a candle, twists the neck of a terrified cock, or smashes a
saucer. The Christian kisses the New Testament; the Jew kisses the Old. The
Christian swears with his hat off; the Jew with his hat on. I could multiply
anomalies, all opposed to each other. Which kind of obligation would you prefer
from me? A cock or a hen? Produce the sacred symbol, and I am ready. Shall my
head be covered or uncovered? As you please. Ah, how strange! With this pencil
and penholder my fingers have insensibly formed a cross. Shall I swear upon
that, and will it content you? Take your choice, my dear sir, take your choice.
Call me Jew, Christian, Pagan, Chinaman--which you please. I am willing to
oblige you. Or shall we be sensible. Will you take my simple word for it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will,&quot; I said; &quot;but I must have a hostage.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Anything, anything, my dear sir. Give it a name.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your desk,&quot; I said, &quot;which not unlikely contains private
writings and confessions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It does,&quot; he replied, tapping on the desk with his knuckles.
&quot;You little dream of the treasures, the strange secrets, herein contained. You
would have this as a hostage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It shall be yours, on the understanding that if I claim it
from you within three months after the mystery of the murder of Lizzie Melladew
is cleared up, you will deliver it to me again intact, with its contents
unread.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise faithfully,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must trouble you,&quot; he said; and he suddenly placed his hand
upon my forehead, and stood over me. &quot;Yes,&quot; he said, resuming his seat, &quot;the
promise is faithfully made. You will keep it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He locked the desk, and pushed it across the table to me,
putting the key in his pocket.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And now, your word of truth and honour,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give me your hand. On my truth and honour I pledge myself to
you. Moreover, if it will ease your mind of an absurd suspicion, I declare, on
my truth and honour, that I have had nothing whatever to do with this murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His words carried conviction with them.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But you will assist me in my search?&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To the extent of my power. Understand, however, that I do not
undertake that your search shall be successful. It does not depend upon me;
accident will probably play its part in the matter. There is a clause, moreover,
in our agreement to which I require your adhesion. It is, that during your
search you will do nothing to fasten publicity upon me, and that, in the event
of your succeeding, I shall not be dragged into the case.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Unless you are required as a witness,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall not be required. I have no evidence to offer which a
court of law would accept.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is to be the judge of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You yourself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I agree. You must not regard me as a spy upon your movements
when I tell you I shall sleep in this house to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. That you are a man of mettle--a man who can form
a resolution and carry it out, never mind at what inconvenience to
yourself--makes your company agreeable to me. I like you; I accept you as my
comrade, for a brief space, in lieu of that miserable groveller Lemon, who has
no more strength of nerve than a jelly-fish. Sleep in the house, and welcome.
Sleep in this room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where?&quot; I asked, looking around for the accommodation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A shake-down on the floor. Our mutual good friend Mrs. Lemon
shall bring up a mattress, a pillow, a sheet, and a pair of blankets, and you
shall lie snug and warm. I do not offer you my own bed, for I know that, having
the instincts of a gentleman, you would not accept it, but I offer you the
hospitality of my poor apartment. We will sup together, we will sleep together,
in the morning we will breakfast together, and we will go out to business
together, you taking the position of poor Lemon, whom, from this moment, I cast
off for ever. What say you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I debated with myself. It was important that I should not lose
sight of Devlin; left to my own resources, I should not know how to proceed; I
depended entirely upon him to supply me with a clue. But what could be his
reason for proposing that we should go out to business together? Of what use
could I be in a barber's shop, and how would my presence there assist me? As,
however, he appeared to be dealing frankly and honestly, my best course perhaps
would be to do the same. Therefore I put the questions which perplexed me in
plain language.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; he replied, &quot;in my place of business, and in no
other place, shall we be able to find a starting-point. Do not entail upon me
the necessity of saying 'upon my truth and honour' to everything I advance. Have
confidence in me, and you will be a thousand pounds the richer, probably two, if
the gentleman who made you the offer keeps his word.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I hesitated no longer. I would act frankly and boldly, and for
the next twenty-four hours at least would be guided by him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I accept your hospitality,&quot; I said, &quot;and will do as you
wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good,&quot; he said, rubbing his hands; &quot;we may regard the
campaign as opened. Woe to the murderer! Justice shall overtake him; he shall
hang!&quot; He uttered these words in a tone of malignant satisfaction, and as though
the prospect of any man being hanged was thoroughly agreeable to him. &quot;I will
prove to you,&quot; he continued, &quot;how completely you can trust me. You came here
to-day with the intention of returning home and sleeping there. Your absence
will alarm your wife. You must write to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He placed notepaper and envelopes before me, and took from the
mantelshelf a penny stone bottle of ink, then pointed to the pen which formed
part of the cross upon the table.</p>

<p class="normal">I wrote a line to my wife, informing her that events of great
importance had occurred in relation to the murder of Lizzie Melladew, and that,
for the purpose of following up the threads of a possible discovery, I intended
to sleep out to-night; I desired her in my letter to go and see Mr. Portland and
tell him that I was engaged in the task he had intrusted to me, and believed I
should soon be in possession of a clue. &quot;Have no anxiety for me,&quot; I said; &quot;I am
quite safe, and no harm will befall me. The prospect of unravelling this
dreadful mystery fills me with joy.&quot; She would know what I meant by this; the
murderer discovered, we should be comparatively rich. I fastened and addressed
my letter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It should reach her hands to-night,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;How will
you send it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I stepped to the window, and, looking out, distinguished the
figures of George Carton and Mr. Kenneth Dowsett, Mr. Dowsett seemed to be
endeavouring, unavailingly, to persuade his ward to come away with him. I could
employ no better messenger than George Carton; he should take my letter to my
wife. Returning to the centre of the room, my eyes fell upon Devlin's desk.
Devlin smiled and nodded; he knew what was passing in my mind.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall send my letter,&quot; I said, &quot;by the hands of George
Carton, who is still in the square, and I shall send your desk with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do so,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">I opened the envelope, and tearing it into very small pieces
flung them out of window. Devlin smiled again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that I should not discover your address,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is it,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is likely,&quot; he said, &quot;to be not very far from Mr.
Melladew, because you and he are friends.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I added a few words to my letter, desiring my wife to put the
desk in a place of safety; and then, addressing another envelope, I went
down-stairs, bearing both desk and letter.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall be here when you come back,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;Even were
I protean, I shall not change my shape. My word is given.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">On my way to the street-door I encountered Fanny Lemon.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, sir?&quot; she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will speak to you presently,&quot; I said, and, opening the
street-door, crossed the road to where George Carton and his guardian were
standing.</p>

<h5>I SEND DEVLIN'S DESK TO MY WIFE, AND SMOKE A FRAGRANT CIGAR.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;This foolish, headstrong lad will be the death of me,&quot; said
Mr. Dowsett in a fretful tone, &quot;and of himself as well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am neither foolish nor headstrong,&quot; retorted the unhappy
young man. &quot;I told you he was in there still, and you told me he had left the
house.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I said it for your good,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, &quot;but you will not
be ruled.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, I will not!&quot; exclaimed George Carton violently; and then
said remorsefully, &quot;I beg you to forgive me for speaking so wildly; it is the
height of ingratitude after all your goodness to me. But do you not see--for
God's sake, do you not see--that you are making things worse instead of better
for me by opposing me as you are doing? I will have my way! I will, whether I am
right or wrong!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My poor boy,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, addressing me, &quot;has got it
into his foolish head that you can be of some assistance to him. In heaven's
name, how can you be?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Dowsett,&quot; I said, and the strange experiences of the last
few hours imported, I felt, a solemnity into my voice, &quot;the ends of justice are
sometimes reached by roads we cannot see. It may be so in this sad instance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There,&quot; said George Carton to his guardian, in a tone of
melancholy triumph, &quot;did I not tell you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett shrugged his shoulders impatiently, and said, &quot;I
declare that if I did not love my ward with a love as sincere and perfect as any
human being ever felt for another, I would wash my hands of this business
altogether.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But why,&quot; said Carton, with much affection, &quot;do you torment
yourself about it at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is you I torment myself about,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett, &quot;not the
horrible deed. I love you with a father's love, and I cannot leave you in the
state you are.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">George Carton put his arm around his guardian caressingly. &quot;I
am not worth it,&quot; he murmured; &quot;I am not worth it; but I cannot act otherwise
than I do. Sir&quot;--to me--&quot;I have lingered here in the hope that you might have
some news to tell me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have nothing I can communicate to you,&quot; I said; &quot;but rest
assured that my interest in the discovery of the murderer is scarcely less than
yours. I have taken up the search, and I will not rest while there is the shadow
of a hope left.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I knew it, I knew it,&quot; said George Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Knowing it, then,&quot; I said, &quot;and receiving the assurance from
my lips, will you do me a service, and be guided by my advice?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, indeed I will,&quot; replied Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is heartbreaking,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett mournfully, turning
his head, &quot;to find a stranger's counsel preferred to mine.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, no,&quot; cried George Carton, &quot;I declare to you, no! But you
would have me do nothing, and I cannot obey you. I cannot--I cannot sit idly
down, and make no effort in the cause of justice. My dear Lizzie is dead, and I
do not care to live. But I will live for one thing--revenge!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Be calm,&quot; I said, taking the young man's fevered hand, &quot;and
listen to me. I wish you to take this letter and desk to my wife, and deliver
them to her with your own hands. Will you do so?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must not part with them under any pretext or persuasion
until you place them in my wife's possession.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No one shall touch them till she receives them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You must go at once, for she is anxious about me. I intend to
sleep here to-night. And when you have done what I ask you, I beg you to go home
with your guardian, and have a good night's rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He looked discontented at this, but Mr. Dowsett said, &quot;Be
persuaded, George, be persuaded!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Believe me,&quot; I said, speaking very earnestly, &quot;that it will
be for the best.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well, sir. I will do as you desire. But&quot;--turning to Mr.
Dowsett--&quot;no opiates. If sleep comes to me, it shall come naturally.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I promise you, George,&quot; said Mr. Dowsett; &quot;and now let us go.
Thank you, sir, thank you a thousand times, for having prevailed upon my ward to
do what is right. Come, George, come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was so anxious to get the young man away that he advanced a
few steps quickly; thus for two or three moments Carton and I were alone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Shall I see you to-morrow, sir,&quot; asked Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In all probability,&quot; I replied; &quot;but do not seek me here. I
have your address, and will either call upon or write to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then I am to remain home all day?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. By following my instructions you will be rendering me
practical assistance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very well, sir. I put all my trust in you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you coming, George?&quot; cried Mr. Dowsett, looking back.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, I am ready,&quot; said the young man, joining his guardian;
and presently they were both out of sight.</p>

<p class="normal">I rentered the house. Fanny Lemon was still in the passage.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fanny,&quot; I said, &quot;I cannot keep long with you, as I have
business up-stairs with Mr. Devlin; but I wish to impress upon you not to speak
to a single soul of what has passed between us to-day. Say nothing to anybody
about Mr. Lemon being ill, and, above all, do not call in a doctor. Doctors are
apt to be inquisitive, and it is of the highest importance that curiosity shall
not be aroused in the minds of the neighbours. There is nothing radically wrong
with Lemon; he has received a fright, and his nerves are shaken, that is all.
Tell him that I have taken his place with Devlin, and that the partnership is at
an end. That will relieve his mind. Keep him quiet, and give him nothing to
drink but milk or barley water. Lower his system, Fanny, lower his system.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't you think it low enough already, sir?&quot; asked Fanny.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not; he is in a state of dangerous excitement, and
everything must be done to soothe and quiet him. But I have no more time to
waste. You will do as I have told you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir, I'll be careful to. But are you sure he don't want
a doctor? Are you sure he won't die?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite sure; and you can tell him, if you like, that <i>I</i>
say it is all right.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;<i>Is</i> it all right, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If it isn't, I'm going to try to make it so. I shall sleep
here to-night, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And welcome, sir. We haven't a spare bedroom, but I can make
you up a bed on the sofa in the parlour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall not need it. I am going to sleep in Devlin's room, on
the floor.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She caught my arm with a cry of alarm. &quot;Has he got hold of
you, too, sir? The Lord save us! He's got the lot of us in his claws!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't be absurd,&quot; I said. &quot;I know what I'm about, and Mr.
Devlin will find me a match for him. No more questions; do as you are bid. If
you have a mattress and some bedclothes to spare, bring them up at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I won't look at him, sir--I won't speak to him! O, how shall
I ever forgive myself--how shall I ever forgive myself?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She threw her apron (which during my absence she had put on
over her faded black silk dress) over her head, and swayed to and fro in the
passage, moaning and groaning in great distress of mind.</p>

<p class="normal">I pulled the apron from her face, and gave her a good shaking
by way of corrective. She ceased her moans.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have no patience with you, Fanny,&quot; I exclaimed. &quot;In
heaven's name, what do you want to be forgiven for?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For dragging you into this horrible business, sir,&quot; she said,
with a tendency to relapse, which I immediately checked by another shaking.
&quot;That--that devil up-stairs----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">This time I shook her so soundly that she could not get out
another word for the chattering of her teeth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No more, Fanny,&quot; I said roughly, &quot;or you will make me angry.
I know what I am about, and if you don't stop instantly and do exactly as I bid
you, I'll leave you and your Lemon to your fate. Do you hear?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The threat terrified her into calmness.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll bring up the bed-things, sir,&quot; she said, with bated
breath.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And lose no time,&quot; I said, as I mounted the stairs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I won't, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin was smoking when I joined him, and not smoking a pipe,
but a cigar with a most delicious fragrance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take one,&quot; he said, pushing a cigar-case over to me; &quot;you
will find them good. I manufactured them while you were away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I bore good-humouredly with his banter, and I took a cigar
from the case, but did not immediately light it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sent your letter?&quot; he inquired curtly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And my desk?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By Lizzie Melladew's sweetheart?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not by the other?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do they live together?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Capital!&quot; he said, with the air of a man who had been asking
important instead of trivial questions. &quot;There is a knock at the door--a
frightened, feminine knock. Enter, my dear Mrs. Lemon, enter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Fanny Lemon came in, smothered with a mattress, sheets,
blankets, and pillows, and, without uttering a word, proceeded to make the bed
on the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have brought plenty of pillows, Fanny,&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I thought you'd like to lay high, sir,&quot; she whispered.</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin broke out into a loud laugh. &quot;Most people do,&quot; he said,
&quot;while they live. When they die they all lie low&mdash;all of them, all of them!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">For a moment I thought that Fanny was going to run away, but a
look from me restrained her, and she finished making the bed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you wish anything else, sir?&quot; she asked, still in a
whisper, and keeping her back to Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, my charming landlady, yes,&quot; replied Devlin, &quot;A large pot
of your exquisite tea. Fly!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Make it, Fanny, and bring it up,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">She flew, and returned with the steaming pot. Surely never was
tea so quickly prepared before. The pot, milk, sugar, and two cups and saucers
were on a tray, which, without raising her eyes, she placed before me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here, here,&quot; cried Devlin, tapping the table. &quot;Before <i>me</i>,
my dear creature! <i>I</i> am the host on this occasion.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She slid the tray over to him, and he made a motion as if he
were about to place his hand on her.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If you lay a finger on me,&quot; she exclaimed, beating a hasty
retreat from the table, &quot;I'll scream the house down!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leave the room,&quot; I said sternly; &quot;and call us at seven in the
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We shall be here, my dear creature,&quot; added Devlin. &quot;You will
find both of us safe and sound, ready to do justice to your excellent cooking. I
have a premonition of a fine appetite for breakfast; cook me an extra rasher.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I saw in Fanny's eyes a desire to say a word to me alone.
Devlin saw it too.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Humour her,&quot; he said, and quoted a line from a comedy. &quot;What
is the use of a friend if you can't make a stranger of him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I followed Fanny into the passage.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You've quite made up your mind, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite, Fanny.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take this, sir,&quot; she said, pushing a hard substance into my
hands. &quot;If anything happens in the night, spring it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was a policeman's rattle.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know where Lemon got it from,&quot; she said, &quot;but we've
had it in the house for years.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pshaw, Fanny!&quot; I said, forcing the rattle back into her
hands. &quot;You are too ridiculous!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Yet when I was once again face to face with Devlin, with the
door locked, I could not help thinking that I was acting a perilous part in
putting myself, as it were, into his power. He might kill me while I slept. I
determined to keep awake, and to lie down in my clothes.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have some tea?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Thank you,&quot; I replied. The tea would assist me in my resolve
not to sleep.</p>

<p class="normal">The teapot being emptied, I lit the cigar Devlin had given me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I owe you an explanation,&quot; he said, puffing the smoke from
his cigar into a series of circles. &quot;I take it as a fact that Lemon is suffering
from some kind of prophetic vision in connection with the murder of Lizzie
Melladew in Victoria Park on Friday night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is so,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Part of my explanation lies in the admission that he received
that forewarning from me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then you knew it was done,&quot; I cried.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not know it. It passed through the mind of a customer
whose hair I was dressing. I do not call that knowing a thing. I am something of
a thought-reader, my dear sir, and I possess a certain power, under suitable
conditions, of conveying my impressions to another person. That is the extent of
my explanation. Excuse me for making it so brief.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Never in my life had I smoked a cigar with a fragrance so
exquisite. Not only exquisite, but overpowering. It beguiled my senses, and had
such an effect upon me that the last twenty or thirty words uttered by Devlin
seemed to be spoken at a great distance from me. This sense of distance affected
not only his voice, but himself and all surrounding things. He and they seemed
to recede into space, as it were, not bounded by the walls of the small
apartment in which we were sitting. I had a dim desire to continue the
conversation, and to press Devlin to be more explicit, but it died away.
Everything floated in a mist around me, and in this state I fell asleep.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_23" href="#div1Ref_23">CHAPTER XXIII.</a></h4>

<h5>I PASS A MORNING IN DEVLIN'S PLACE OF BUSINESS.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Devlin was up and dressed when I awoke in the morning. I had
not to go through the trouble of putting on my clothes, as I had not taken them
off on the previous night. It would not have surprised me to find that I had
unconsciously sought repose in the usual way, or that I had risen in my sleep to
undress; nothing, indeed, would very much have surprised me, so strange had been
my dreaming fancies. Naturally they all turned upon Devlin and the case upon
which I was engaged. I could easily write a chapter upon them, but I will
content myself with briefly describing one of the strangest of them all.</p>

<p class="normal">I was sitting in a chair, opposite a mirror, in which I saw
everything that was passing in the room. Devlin was standing over me, dressing
my hair. Suddenly I saw a sharp surgical instrument in his hand.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is not a razor,&quot; I said, &quot;and I don't want to be
shaved.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; remarked Devlin, with excessive politeness,
&quot;what you want or what you don't want matters little.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With that he made a straight cut across the top of my head,
and laid bare my brains. I saw them and every little cell in them quite
distinctly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To think,&quot; he observed, as he peered into the cavities, &quot;that
in this small compass should abide the passions, the emotions, the meannesses,
the noble aspirations, the sordid desires, the selfish instincts and the power
to resist them, the sense of duty, the conscious deceits, the lust for power,
the grovelling worship, the filthy qualities of animalism, the secret
promptings, and all the motley mental and moral attributes which make a man! To
think that from this small compass have sprung all that constitutes man's
history--religion, ethics, the rise and fall of nations, music, poetry, law, and
science! How grand, how noble does this man, who represents humankind, think
himself! What works he has executed, what marvels discovered! But if the truth
were known, he is a mere dabbler, who, out of his conceit, magnifies the
smallest of molehills into the largest of mountains. He can build a bridge, but
he cannot make a flower that shall bloom to-day and die to-morrow. He can
destroy, but he cannot create. In the open page of Nature he makes the most
trivial of discoveries, and he straightway writes himself up in letters of gold
and builds monuments in his honour. The stars mock him; the mountains of snow
look loftily down upon the pigmy; the gossamer fly which his eyes can scarcely
see triumphs over his highest efforts. But he has invented for himself a supreme
shelter for defeat and decay. Dear me, dear me--I cannot find it!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you looking for?&quot; I asked. &quot;Be kind enough to leave
my brains alone.&quot; For he was industriously probing them with some sensitive
instrument.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am looking for your grand invention, your soul. I am
wondrously wise, but I have never yet been able to discover its precise
locality.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">After some further search he shut up my head, so to speak, and
my fancies took another direction.</p>

<p class="normal">All these vagaries seemed to be tumbling over each other in my
brain as I rose from my bed on the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Had a good night?&quot; asked Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If being asleep,&quot; I replied, &quot;means having a good night, I
have had it. But my head is in a whirl, nevertheless.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Keep it cool if you can,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;for what you have to
go through. You will find water and soap inside.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He pointed to the little closet adjoining his room, and there
I found all that was necessary for my toilet. I had just finished when Fanny
knocked at the door.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It's all right, Fanny,&quot; I cried. &quot;You can get breakfast
ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And don't forget,&quot; added Devlin, &quot;the extra rasher for me.
How is dear Lemon?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">That she did not reply and was heard beating a hasty retreat
caused a broad grin to spread over Devlin's face.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have provided,&quot; he said, &quot;for that worthy creature
something of an entertaining, not to say enthralling, nature, which she can
dilate upon to the last hour of her life. And yet she is not grateful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">We went down to breakfast, and there I was afforded an
opportunity of verifying the subtle likeness in Devlin's face to the portrait of
Lemon on the wall, the evil-looking bird in its glass case, and the stone
figure, half monster, half man, on the mantelshelf.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is a likeness,&quot; said Devlin pleasantly, &quot;between my
works and me, and if you will attribute me with anything human, you can
attribute it to a common human failing. It springs from the vanity and the
weakness of man that he can evolve only that which is within himself. Nowhere is
that vanity and weakness more conspicuous than in Genesis, in the very first
chapter, my dear sir, where man himself has had the audacity to write that 'God
created man in His own image.' My dear Mrs. Lemon, you have excelled yourself
this morning. This rasher is perfect, and your cooking of these eggs to the
infinitesimal part of a second is a marvel of art.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Fanny did not open her lips to him, and the meal passed on in
silence so far as she was concerned. I made a good breakfast, and Devlin
expressed approval of my appetite.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will strengthen you,&quot; he said, &quot;for what is before you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Fanny looked up in alarm, and Devlin laughed. I may mention
that the first thing I did when I came down-stairs was to run to the nearest
newspaper shop and purchase copies of the morning papers.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there anything new concerning the murder?&quot; asked Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">Fanny waited breathlessly for my reply.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have any arrests been made?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course,&quot; observed Devlin sarcastically, &quot;the police are on
the track of the murderer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is something to that effect in the papers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fudge!&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">Breakfast over, Devlin said he would go up to his room for a
few minutes, and bade me be ready when he came down. Alone with Fanny, she asked
me whether I would like to see Lemon, adding that it would do him &quot;a power of
good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he any better?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I really think he is,&quot; she replied. &quot;What I told him last
night about your taking up the case was a comfort to him--though he ain't easy
in his mind about you. He is afraid that Devlin will get hold of you as he did
of him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He will not, Fanny. We shall get along famously together.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">She shook her head. I failed to convince her, as I failed to
convince Mr. Lemon, that I should prove a match for their lodger. Lemon
presented a ludicrous picture, sitting up in bed with an old-fashioned nightcap
on.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't go with him, sir,&quot; he whispered, &quot;to the Twisted Cow.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I shall go with him,&quot; I said, &quot;wherever he proposes to take
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I could not help smiling at Lemon's expression of melancholy
as I made this statement. He dared not give utterance to his fears of what my
ultimate destination would be if I continued to keep company with Devlin. When
that strange personage came down I was ready for him, and we went out together,
Fanny looking after us from the street-door, shaking, I well knew, in her inward
soul.</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin made himself exceedingly pleasant, and the comments he
passed on the people we met excited my admiration and increased my wonder. He
seemed to be able to read their characters in their faces, and although I would
have liked to combat his views I did not venture to oppose my judgment to his.
What struck me particularly was that he saw the evil in men, not the good. Not
once did he give man or woman credit for the possession of good qualities. All
was mean, sordid, grasping, and selfish. He told me that we should have to walk
four miles to his place of business.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I enjoy walking,&quot; he said, &quot;and the only riding I care for is
on the top of an omnibus through squalid streets. You get peeps into garrets and
one-room habitations. Gifted with the power of observation, you can see rare
pictures there.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">On our road I stopped at a post-office, and sent a telegram of
three words to my wife: &quot;All is well.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Our course lay in the direction of Westminster. We crossed the
bridge, and turned down a narrow street. Chapel Street. Half-way down the street
Devlin paused, and said,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Behold our establishment.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was a poor and common house, and had it not been for a
barber's pole sticking out from the doorway, and a fly-blown cardboard in the
parlour window, on which was written, &quot;Barber and Hairdresser. All styles.
Lowest charges,&quot; I should not have supposed that a trade was carried on therein.
As we entered the passage a woman came forward and handed Devlin a key. He
thanked her, unlocked the parlour door, and we went in.</p>

<p class="normal">The fittings in this room, which I saw at a glance was the
shop in which the shaving and hair-dressing were done, were entirely out of
keeping with the poor tenement in which it was situated. The walls were lined
with fine mirrors; there were three luxurious barber's chairs; the washstands
were of marble; and the appliances for shampooing perfect.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You would hardly expect it,&quot; observed Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I would not,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is my idea,&quot; he said. &quot;It rivals the West End
establishments, and for skill I would challenge the world, if I were desirous of
courting publicity. Then, the charges. One-sixth those of Truefit. I shave for a
penny, cut for another penny, shampoo for another. But only those can be
attended to who hold my tickets. I was compelled to adopt this plan, otherwise I
should have been overwhelmed with customers. It enables me to choose them. When
I see a likely man, one who is ripe, and in whom I discern possibilities which
commend themselves to me, I say, 'Oblige me, sir, by accepting this ticket of
admission;' and having given him a taste of my skill, he comes again. I have
quite a connection.&quot; He accompanied these last words with a strange smile.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What part do you propose to assign to me in the business?&quot; I
asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A part to which you will not object, that of looker-on. Not
from this room, but that&quot;--pointing to the back room. &quot;The panels of the door,
you will observe, are of ground glass. Sitting within there, you can see all
that passes in this room without being yourself seen. If you will keep quiet, no
one will suspect that you are in hiding.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For the life of me,&quot; I said, &quot;I cannot guess what good my
sitting in there will do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not suppose you can; but learn from me that I do nothing
without a motive. I do not care to be questioned too closely. The promise I have
made to you will be kept if you do not thwart it. You may see something that
will surprise you. I say 'may,' because I have not the power to entirely rule
men's movements. But I think it almost certain he will pay me a visit this
morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He?&quot; I cried. &quot;Who?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The man whose thoughts I read on Friday with respect to the
girl who was murdered on that night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I started. If Devlin spoke the truth, and if the man came to
his shop this morning, I should be in possession of a practical clue which would
lead me to the goal I wished to reach.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He comes regularly,&quot; continued Devlin, &quot;on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays. This is his day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know his name?&quot; I inquired, in great excitement.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not,&quot; replied Devlin, &quot;the last time I saw him. How
should I know it now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor where he lives?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nor where he lives.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I must obey you, I suppose,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It will be advisable, and you must obey me implicitly.
Deviate by a hair's breadth from what I require of you, and I withdraw my
promise, which now exists in full integrity. Decide.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have decided. I will remain in that room.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is another point upon which I must insist positively.
From that room you do not stir until I bid you; in that room you do not speak
unless you receive a cue from me. Agreed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Agreed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On your honour?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;On my honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good. Now you can retire. You will find books in there to
amuse you if you get wearied with your watch.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He opened the door for me, and closed it upon me. He had
spoken correctly. Through the ground glass I could see everything in the shop,
and I took his word for it that I could not myself be seen.</p>

<p class="normal">Scarcely had a minute passed before a customer entered.
Devlin, who, while he was arguing with me, had taken off his coat, and put on a
linen jacket of spotless white, behaved most decorously. His manner was
deferential without being subservient, respectful without being familiar. The
man was shaved by Devlin, and then his head was brushed by machinery, which I
had forgotten to mention was fixed in the shop. There was a caressing motion
about Devlin's shapely hands which could not but be agreeable to those who
sought his tonsorial aid, and his conversation, judging from the expression on
his customer's face, must have been amusing and entertaining. The customer took
his departure, and another, appearing as he went out, was duly attended to. This
went on until eleven o'clock by my watch, and nothing had occurred of especial
interest to me. Devlin was kept pretty busy; but, although his time was fully
employed, the business at such prices could not have been remunerative,
especially when it was considered that the fitting up of the shop must have cost
a pretty sum of money, and that the profits of the concern had to be divided
between two persons, Mr. Lemon and himself. It was not till past eleven that my
attention was more than ordinarily attracted by Devlin's behaviour, the
difference in which perhaps no one except myself would have particularly
noticed. A man of the middle class entered and took his seat. He wore a beard
and moustache; and although I could not hear what he said, he spoke in so low a
tone, I judged correctly that he instructed Devlin to shave his face bare.
Devlin proceeded to obey him, and clipped and cut, and finally applied his razor
until not a vestige of hair was left on the man's face. That being done, Devlin
cut this customer's hair close, and then used his brushes; and as his hands
moved about the man's head there was, if I may so describe it, a feline,
insinuating expression in them which aroused my curiosity. I thought of the
singular dream I have described, and it appeared to me that all the while Devlin
was employed over his customer the brains of the man sitting so quietly in the
chair were figuratively exposed to his view, and that he was reading the
thoughts which stirred therein. When the man was gone there was a peculiar smile
upon Devlin's face, and I observed that he laughed quietly to himself. There
happened to be no one in the shop to claim Devlin's attention, and I, who was
impatiently waiting for some sign from Devlin pertinent to the secret purpose to
which both he and I were pledged, expected it to be given now; for the
circumstance of the man having been shaved bare--which so altered his appearance
that I should not otherwise have known that the person who entered the shop was
the same person who left it--was to me so suspicious that in my anxiety and
agitation I connected it with the murder of poor Lizzie Melladew, arguing that
the man had effected this disguise in himself for the purpose of escaping
detection. But Devlin made no sign, and did not even look towards the
glass-door. Other customers coming in, Devlin was busy again. Twelve
o'clock--half-past twelve--one o'clock-and still no indication of anything in
connection with my task. With a feeling of intense disappointment, and beginning
to doubt whether I had not allowed myself to be duped, I replaced my watch in my
pocket, and had scarcely done so before my heart was beating violently at the
appearance of a gentleman whom I little expected to see in Devlin's shop. This
gentleman was no other than Mr. Kenneth Dowsett, George Carton's guardian.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_24" href="#div1Ref_24">CHAPTER XXIV.</a></h4>

<h5>MR. KENNETH DOWSETT GIVES ME THE SLIP.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The beating of my heart became normal; I suppose it was the
sudden appearance of a gentleman with whose face I was familiar, after many
hours of suspense, that had caused its pulsations to become so rapid and
violent. There was nothing surprising, after all, in the presence of Mr. Dowsett
in Devlin's shop. His address was in Westminster, Devlin was an exceptionally
fine workman, the accommodation was luxurious, the charges low. Even I, in my
position in life, would be tempted to deal occasionally with so expert and
perfect a barber as Devlin, at the prices he charged. Then, why not Mr. Kenneth
Dowsett? Besides, he might be of a frugal turn.</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin was not long engaged over him. Mr. Dowsett was shaved;
Mr. Dowsett had his hair brushed by machinery; Mr. Dowsett, moreover, was very
particular as to the arrangement of his hair; and Devlin, I saw, did his best to
please him. But so deft and facile was Devlin that he did not dally with Mr.
Dowsett for longer than five or six minutes. Mr. Dowsett rose, paid Devlin,
exchanged a few smiling words with him, and taking a final look at himself in
the mirrors, turning himself this way and that, walked out of the shop.
Evidently Mr. Dowsett was a very vain man.</p>

<p class="normal">No sooner was he gone than Devlin locked the shop-door from
within, whipped off his linen jacket, and opened the door of the room in which I
was sitting. I came forward in no amiable mood.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are wearied with your long enforced rest,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am wearied and disgusted,&quot; I retorted. &quot;I expected a clue.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you not received it?&quot; asked Devlin, smiling.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Received it!&quot; I echoed. &quot;How? Where?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You have seen my customers, and all that has passed between
me and them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well?&quot; he said, mocking me. &quot;Is there not one among them upon
whom your suspicions are fixed? Is there not one among them who could, if he
chose, supply us with a starting-point? I say 'us,' because we are comrades.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Fool, fool, that I was!&quot; I exclaimed, involuntarily raising
my hand to my forehead. &quot;Why did I allow him to escape?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why did you let whom escape you?&quot; asked Devlin, in a
bantering tone.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The man whose beard and moustache you shaved off. He must
have a reason, a vital reason, for effecting this disguise in himself. And I
have let him slip through my fingers!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has a vital reason for so disguising himself,&quot; said
Devlin, &quot;but it has no connection with the murder of Lizzie Melladew.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot; I cried, &quot;by asking me whether I have
not received a clue?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was your attention attracted to no other of my customers than
this man?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was only one who was known to me--Mr. Kenneth Dowsett.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Devlin. &quot;Mr. Kenneth Dowsett.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">A light seemed to dawn suddenly upon me, but the suggestion
conveyed in Devlin's significant tone so amazed me that I could not receive it
unquestioningly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you mean to tell me,&quot; I cried, &quot;that you suspect Mr.
Dowsett of complicity in this frightful murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I mean to tell you nothing of my suspicions,&quot; replied Devlin.
&quot;It is for you, not for me, to suspect. It is for you, not for me, to draw
conclusions. What I know positively of Mr. Dowsett--with whose name I was
unacquainted until last evening, when you mentioned it in Lemon's house--I will
tell you, if you wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Tell me, then.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is short but pregnant. Through Mr. Kenneth Dowsett's mind,
as I shaved him and dressed his hair on Friday last, passed the picture of a
beautiful girl, with golden hair, wearing a bunch of white daisies in her belt.
Through his mind passed a picture of a lake of still water in Victoria Park.
Through his mind passed a vision of blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Are you a devil,&quot; I exclaimed, &quot;that you did not step in to
prevent the deed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; he said, seizing my arm, which I had
involuntarily raised, and holding it as in a vice, &quot;you are unreasonable. I have
never in my life been in Victoria Park, which, I believe, covers a large space
of ground. Why should I elect to pass an intensely uncomfortable night,
wandering about paths in an unknown place, to interfere in I know not what? Even
were I an interested party, it would be an act of folly, for such a proceeding
would lay me open to suspicion. A nice task you would allot to me when you
tacitly declare that it should be my mission to prevent the commission of human
crime! Then how was I to gauge the precise value of Mr. Dowsett's thoughts? He
might be a dramatist, inventing a sensational plot for a popular theatre; he
might be an author of exciting fiction. Give over your absurdities, and school
yourself into calmer methods. Unless you do so, you will have small chance of
unravelling this mystery. And consider, my dear sir,&quot; he added, making me a
mocking bow, &quot;if I am a devil, how honoured you should be that I accept you as
my comrade!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The tone in which he spoke was calm and measured; indeed, it
had not escaped my observation that, whether he was inclined to be malignant or
agreeable, insinuating or threatening, he never raised his voice above a certain
pitch. I inwardly acknowledged the wisdom of his counsel that I should keep my
passion in control, and I resolved from that moment to follow it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You locked the shop-door,&quot; I said, &quot;when Mr. Dowsett left you
just now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did,&quot; was his response, &quot;thinking it would be your wish
that I should do no more business to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should you think that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Because of what was passing through Mr. Dowsett's mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I ask you to pardon me for my display of passion. What was
Mr. Dowsett thinking of?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of two very simple matters,&quot; said Devlin; &quot;the time of day
and an address. The time was fifteen minutes past three, the address, 28
Athelstan Road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing more?&quot; I inquired, much puzzled.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I pondered a moment; I could draw no immediate conclusion from
material so bare. I asked Devlin what he could make of it; he replied, politely,
that it was for me, not for him, to make what I could of it. A suggestion
presented itself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;At fifteen minutes past three,&quot; I said, &quot;Mr. Dowsett has an
appointment with some person at 28 Athelstan Road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Possibly,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you a 'London Directory'?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have not; nor, I imagine, will you easily find one in this
neighbourhood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A simpler plan,&quot; I said, &quot;perhaps will be to go to Mr.
Dowsett's house, to which he has most likely returned, and set watch there for
him, keeping ourselves well out of sight. It is now twenty minutes past one; we
can reach his house in ten minutes. He will hardly leave it for his appointment
till two, or a little past. We will follow him secretly, and ascertain whom he
is going to see, and his purpose. I am determined now to adopt bold measures.
Behind this frightful mystery there is another, which shall be brought to light.
You will accompany me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am at your orders,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">We left the house together, and in the time I specified were
within a few yards of Mr. Dowsett's residence. Aware of the importance of not
attracting attention, I looked about for a means of escaping observation. Nearly
opposite Mr. Dowsett's dwelling was a public-house, in the first-floor window of
which I saw a placard, &quot;Billiards. Pool.&quot; I concluded that it was the window of
a billiard-room, and without hesitation I entered the public-house, followed by
Devlin, and mounted the stairs. The room, as I supposed, contained a
billiard-table; the marker, a very pale and very thin youth, was practising the
spot stroke.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Billiards, sir?&quot; he asked, as we entered.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;we wish to play a private game. How much an
hour?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Eighteenpence.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here are five shillings,&quot; I said, &quot;for a couple of hours. We
shall not want you to mark. Don't let us be disturbed.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The pale thin youth took the money, laid down his cue, and
left us to ourselves. When he was gone I placed a chair at an angle against the
handle of the door, there being no key in the lock, and thus prevented the
entrance of any person without notice. It was the leisure time of the day, and
there was little fear of our being disturbed. The extra gratuity I had given to
the marker would insure privacy. As I took my station at the window, from which
Mr. Dowsett's house was in full view, Devlin nodded approval of my proceedings.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are a man of resource,&quot; he said. &quot;I perceive that you
intend henceforth to act sensibly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Minute after minute passed, and there was no sign of any
person leaving or entering Mr. Dowsett's house. Every now and then I consulted
my watch. Two o'clock--a quarter-past two--half-past. I began to grow impatient,
but, to please Devlin, did not exhibit it. Perfect silence reigned between us;
we exchanged not a word.</p>

<p class="normal">Time waned, and now I more frequently looked at my watch, the
hands of which were drawing on to three. They reached the hour and passed it. A
quarter-past three.</p>

<p class="normal">Perplexed and disappointed, I debated on my next move. I soon
decided what it should be. I had promised Richard Carton that I would call upon
him. I would do so now. If Mr. Dowsett was at home, all the better.</p>

<p class="normal">I made Devlin acquainted with my resolve, and he said,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very good; I will go with you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Removing the chair I had placed against the handle of the
door, we went from the public-house and crossed the road. I knocked at Mr.
Dowsett's door, and a maidservant answered the summons.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Does Mr. Kenneth Dowsett live here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is he at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is Mr. Richard Carton in?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give him my card, and say I wish to see him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Will you please walk this way, sir?&quot; said the maidservant.</p>

<p class="normal">She ushered us into the dining-room, where she left us alone
while she went to apprise Richard Carton of my visit. The room was exceedingly
well furnished. Good pictures were on the walls, and there was a tasteful
arrangement of bric-a-brac and bronzes. I had no time for further observation,
the entrance of Richard Carton claiming my attention.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Ah!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;you have come. I was beginning to be
afraid you would disappoint me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You delivered my letter to my wife?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, and the desk. My guardian wanted to persuade me to leave
it till this morning, but I would not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You were quite right.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He looked towards Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A friend,&quot; I said, waving my hand as a kind of introduction,
&quot;who may be of assistance to us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But introduce us plainly,&quot; expostulated Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Devlin,&quot; I said, &quot;Mr. Richard Carton.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">They shook hands, and then Carton inquired whether I had
anything to tell him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Nothing tangible,&quot; I replied, &quot;but we are on the road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; repeated Devlin, &quot;we are on the road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Excuse me for asking,&quot; said Carton to Devlin, &quot;but are you a
detective?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In a spiritual way,&quot; said Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">Carton's mind was too deeply occupied with the one supreme
subject of the murder to ask for an explanation of this enigmatical reply. He
turned towards me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is your guardian in?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; said Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">What should I say next? It would have been folly to make
Richard Carton a participant in the strange revelations which were directing my
proceedings.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can you tell me,&quot; I asked, &quot;where Athelstan Road is?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is in Margate,&quot; he replied, in a tone of surprise, &quot;and
the number is 28.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was my turn now to exhibit surprise. &quot;No. 28!&quot; I exclaimed.
&quot;Who lives there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't know. Mrs. Dowsett and Letitia went to Margate by an
early train on Saturday morning, before I was awake, and my guardian has gone
there to see them. I should have proposed to go with him had it not been for my
determination not to leave London till this dreadful mystery was cleared up; and
then there was the promise you made me give you last night, that I should remain
here all the day till you came to see me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When did your guardian go to Margate?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He has gone from Victoria,&quot; replied Carton, glancing at a
marble clock on the mantelshelf, &quot;by the Granville train. It starts at fifteen
minutes past three.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I also glanced at the clock. It was just half-past three, a
quarter of an hour past the time!</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_25" href="#div1Ref_25">CHAPTER XXV.</a></h4>

<h5>WE FOLLOW IN PURSUIT.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Carton, noticing my discomposure, inquired if there was
anything wrong. I answered, yes; I was afraid there was something very wrong.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In connection with the fate of my poor girl?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied, &quot;in connection with her fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Great heavens!&quot; he cried. &quot;You surely do not suspect that my
guardian is mixed up with it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am of the opinion,&quot; I answered guardedly, &quot;that he may be
able to throw some light on it. Mr. Carton, ask me no further questions, or you
may seriously hamper me. Have you a time-table in the house? No? Then we must
obtain one immediately. It is my purpose to follow your guardian to Margate by
the quickest and earliest train. I give you five minutes to get ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Greatly excited, he darted from the room, and in half the time
I had named returned, with a small bag, into which he had thrust a few articles
of clothing. During his absence I said to Devlin,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will accompany us?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; he replied, &quot;I will go with you to the ends of
the earth. I shall greatly enjoy this pursuit; the vigour and spirit you are
putting into it are worthy of the highest admiration.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">We three went out together, and at the first book-shop I
purchased an &quot;A B C,&quot; and ascertained that the next best train to Margate was
the 5.15 from Victoria, which was timed to arrive at 7.31. Calculating that it
would be a few minutes late, we could, no doubt, reach Athelstan Road at
half-past eight. I had time to run home to my wife, and embrace her and my
children; it was necessary, also, that I should furnish myself with funds, there
being very little money in my purse, and I determined to use the one hundred
pounds which Mr. Portland had left with me. Employed as I was, the use of this
money was justifiable. Hailing a hansom, we jumped into it. Carton sitting on
Devlin's knee, and we soon reached my house. In as few words as possible I
explained to my wife all that was necessary, kissed her and the children, took
possession of the hundred pounds and of a light bag in which my wife had put a
change of clothing, left a private message for Mr. Portland, and rejoined Devlin
and Carton, who were waiting for me in the hansom. I asked my wife but two
questions--the first, how Mr. and Mrs. Melladew were, the second, whether
anything had been heard of the missing daughter Mary. She told me that the
unhappy parents were completely prostrated by the blow, and that no news
whatever had been heard of Mary.</p>

<p class="normal">We arrived at Victoria Station in good time, and, by the aid
of a judicious tip, I secured a first-class compartment, into which the guard
assured me no one should be admitted. I had a distinct reason for desiring this
privacy. There were subjects upon which I wished to talk with Richard Carton,
and I could not carry on the conversation in the presence of strangers. I said
nothing to him of this in the cab, the noise of the wheels making conversation
difficult. We should be two hours and a half getting to Margate, and on the
journey I could obtain all the information I desired. We started promptly to the
minute, and then I requested Carton to give me his best attention. He and I sat
next to each other, Devlin sitting in the opposite corner. He threw himself
back, and closed his eyes, but I knew that he heard every word that passed
between me and Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am going to ask you a series of questions,&quot; I said to the
young man, &quot;not one of which shall be asked from idle curiosity. Answer me as
directly to the point as you can. Explain how it is that Mr. Kenneth Dowsett is
your guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I lost both my parents,&quot; replied Carton, &quot;when I was very
young. Of my mother I have no remembrance whatever; of my father, but little. He
and Mr. Dowsett were upon the most intimate terms of friendship; my father had
such confidence in him that when he drew his will he named Mr. Dowsett as his
executor and my guardian. I was to live with him and his wife, and he was to see
to my education. He has faithfully fulfilled the trust my father reposed in
him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did your father leave a large fortune?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Roughly speaking, I am worth two thousand pounds a year.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Mr. Dowsett, having to receive you in his house as a son and
to look after your education, doubtless was in receipt of a fair consideration
for his services?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, yes. Until I was twenty-one years of age he was to draw
six hundred pounds a year out of the funds invested for me. The balance
accumulated for my benefit until I came of age.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He drew this money regularly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, as he was entitled to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How old are you now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty-four.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You are living still with Mr. Dowsett, and you still regard
him as your guardian?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have a great affection for him; he has treated me most
kindly.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you pay him for your board and lodging?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He continues to receive the six hundred a year. It is all he
has to depend on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was this last arrangement of his own proposing, or yours?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of mine. I cannot sufficiently repay him for his care of me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In your father's will what was to become of your fortune in
the event of your death?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If I died before I came of age, my guardian was to have the
six hundred a year, and the rest was to be given to various charities.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And after you came of age?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was mine absolutely, to do as I pleased with.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you made a will?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who proposed that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are the terms of this will?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have left everything to him. I have no relatives, and no
other claims upon me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When I came to see you this afternoon you mentioned a name
which was new to me. You said that your guardian had gone to Margate with his
wife and 'Letitia.' I supposed he was married, and your speaking of Mrs. Dowsett
did not surprise me. But who is Letitia?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Their daughter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;An only child?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What is her age?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Twenty-two.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Has she a sweetheart? Is she engaged to be married?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That answer seems to me to be given with constraint.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well,&quot; said Carton, &quot;it is hardly right, is it, to go so
minutely into my guardian's private family affairs?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is entirely right. I am engaged upon a very solemn task,
and I can see, probably, what is hidden from you. Why were you partly
disinclined to answer my last question?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is a little awkward,&quot; replied Carton, &quot;because, perhaps, I
am not quite free from blame.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Explain your meaning. Believe me, this may be more serious
than you imagine. Speak frankly. I am acting, indeed, as your true friend.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yet, after all,&quot; said Carton, with hesitation, &quot;I never made
love to her, I give you my honour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Made love to whom? Miss Dowsett?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes. The fact is they looked upon it as a settled thing that
I was to marry Letitia. I did not know it at the time; no, though we were living
in the same house for so many years, I never suspected it. I always looked upon
Letitia as a sister, and I behaved affectionately towards her. They must have
put a wrong construction upon it. When they discovered that I was in love with
my poor Lizzie, Mr. Dowsett said to me, 'It will break Letitia's heart.' Then I
began to understand, and I assure you I felt remorseful. Letitia did not say
anything to me, but I could see by her looks how deeply she was wounded. Once my
guardian made the remark, 'That if I had not met the young lady'--meaning
Lizzie--'his most joyful hope would have been realised,' meaning by that that
when I saw that Letitia loved me I might have grown to love her, and we should
have been married. I said, I remember, that it might have been, for he seemed to
expect something like that from me, and I said it to console him. But it was not
true; I could never have loved Letitia except as a sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did your guardian know the name of the poor girl you have
lost?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, yes. He met us first when we were walking together, and I
introduced him. We had almost a quarrel, my guardian and I, some time
afterwards. He said that Miss Melladew was beneath me, and that it would be
better if I married in my own station in life. I was hurt and angry, and I
begged him to retract his words. Beneath me! She was as far above me as the
highest lady in the land could have been. She was the best, the brightest, the
purest girl in the world. And I have lost her! I have lost her! What hope is
there left to me now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He covered his face with his hands, and I waited till he was
calm before I spoke again.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In my hearing,&quot; I then said, &quot;you have twice made a remark
which struck me as strange. It was to the effect that you would not allow your
guardian to give you any more opiates.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He gave me one last Friday night before I went to bed--on the
night my poor Lizzie was killed. I was excited, because I think I told you, sir,
that it was decided between Lizzie and me that I should go to her father's house
on Sunday, to ask permission to pay my addresses openly to her. Till then I was
not to see her again, and that made me restless. My guardian was anxious about
me, though he did not know the cause of my restlessness and excitement. To
please him I took the opiate, and slept soundly till late in the morning; and
when I woke, sir--when I woke and went out to buy a present for Lizzie, which I
intended to take to Lizzie on Sunday, almost the first thing I heard----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He quite broke down here, and a considerable time elapsed
before he was sufficiently recovered to continue the conversation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Supposing,&quot; I said, &quot;that this dreadful event had not
occurred, and that you and poor Lizzie had been happily married, would you have
continued to give your guardian the income he had enjoyed so long?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not know--I cannot say. Perhaps not; although I never
considered the question. But on the day that I left his house for the home I
dreamt and hoped would be mine, the home in which Lizzie and I would have lived
happily together. I should have given him something handsome, and I am sure I
should always have been his friend. I ought not, perhaps, now that we have gone
so far, to conceal anything from you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed you ought not. Tell me everything; it may help me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am sure,&quot; said the young fellow, with deep feeling, &quot;that
he did not mean it, and that he said it only to comfort me. But it made me mad.
He hinted that my poor Lizzie could not have been true to me, that she must have
had another lover, whom she was in the habit of meeting late at night. If any
other man had dared to say as much I would have killed him. But my guardian
meant no harm, and when he saw how he had wounded me, he begged my pardon
humbly. I am sure, I am sure he repented that he had breathed a suspicion
against my poor girl!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; I said, &quot;for asking you a question which, in any
other circumstances, would not cross my lips; but it will be as well for me to
put it to you. You yourself had no appointment with her on that night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; cried Carton indignantly, &quot;as Heaven is my judge! I
never met her, I never proposed to meet her, at such an hour!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am certain of it. And yet--receive this calmly, if you
can--and yet she must have gone out late on that night for some purpose or
other.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There is the mystery,&quot; said Carton mournfully, &quot;and I have
thought and thought about it without being able to find a key to it. There must
have been a trap set for her--a devilish trap to ensnare her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I think so myself. Otherwise it is not likely she would have
left her home, as she must have done, secretly. Now, a word or two about Mrs.
Dowsett and Letitia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When you woke up on Saturday morning you found that they had
gone to Margate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you know on the day before that they were going?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, nothing was said about it. It was quite sudden.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was Mrs. Dowsett or her daughter ill? Did they go into the
country for their health?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not to my knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Were they in the habit of going away suddenly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, no; they had never done so before.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What explanation did your guardian give?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He said that Letitia had been suffering in secret for some
time, and that her mother thought a change would do her good.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did he tell you where they had gone to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, he did not mention the place. I learnt it from one of the
servants.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that afterwards he was forced to be frank with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I don't understand you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Reflect. When you rose on Saturday morning you found that
Mrs. Dowsett and her daughter had gone away suddenly. You knew nothing at that
moment of poor Lizzie's death, and therefore had nothing to trouble you. Did it
not strike you as strange that your guardian did not mention the part of the
country they had gone to? Or if, your mind being greatly occupied with the
arranged interview with Mr. and Mrs. Melladew on the following day, you did not
then think it strange that your guardian said nothing of Margate--do you not
think so now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Carton thoughtfully, &quot;I do think so now.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How did you learn that Mrs. Dowsett was stopping at 28
Athelstan Road?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By accident. My guardian opened a letter this morning, and a
piece of paper dropped from it. I picked it up, and as I gave it to him I saw 28
Athelstan Road written on it. 'Is that where Mrs. Dowsett and Letitia are
stopping?' I asked; and he answered, 'Yes.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So that it was not directly through him that you learnt the
address?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; but I don't see that it is of any importance.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was not my cue to enter into an argument, therefore I did
not reply to this remark. I had gained from Carton information which, lightly as
he regarded it, I deemed of the highest importance. There was, however, still
something more which I desired to speak of, but which I scarcely knew how to
approach. After a little reflection I made a bold plunge.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is your fortune under your own control?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you keep a large balance at your bank?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Pretty fair; but just now it does not amount to much. Still,
if you want any----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not want any. Am I right in conjecturing that there is a
special reason for your balance being small just now?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There <i>is</i> a special reason. On Saturday morning, before
I left home, I drew a large cheque----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Which you gave to your guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How do you know that?&quot; asked Carton, in a tone of surprise.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was but a guess. What was the amount of the cheque?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Two thousand pounds.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Payable to 'order' or 'bearer'?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To 'bearer.' It was for two investments which Mr. Dowsett
recommended. That was the reason for the cheque being made payable to 'bearer,'
to enable my guardian to pay it to two different firms. He said both the
investments would turn out splendidly, but it matters very little to me now
whether they do or not. All the money in the world will not bring happiness to
me now that my poor Lizzie is dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know whether your guardian cashed the cheque?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I do not; I haven't asked him anything about it. I could
think only of one thing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I can well imagine it. Thank you for answering my questions
so clearly. By and by you may know why I asked them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">These words had hardly passed my lips before Devlin, Carton,
and I were thrown violently against each other. The shock was great, but
fortunately we were not hurt. Screams of pain from adjoining carriages
proclaimed that this was not the case with other passengers. The train was
dragged with erratic force for a considerable distance, and then came to a
sudden standstill.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We had best get out,&quot; said Devlin, who was the first to
recover.</p>

<p class="normal">We followed the sensible advice, and, upon emerging from the
carriage, discovered that other carriages were overturned, and that the line was
blocked. Happily, despite the screams of the frightened passengers, the injuries
they had met with were slight, and when all were safely got out we stood along
the line, gazing helplessly at each other. Devlin, however, was an exception; he
was the only perfectly composed person amongst us.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is unfortunate,&quot; he said, with a certain maliciousness in
his voice; &quot;we are not half-way to Margate. The best laid schemes are liable to
come to grief. If Mr. Kenneth Dowsett knew of this, he would rejoice.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was with intense anxiety that I made inquiries of the guard
whether the accident would delay us long. The guard answered that he could not
say yet, but that to all appearance we should be delayed two or three hours. I
received this information with dismay. It would upon that calculation be
midnight before we reached our destination. I considered time so precious that I
would have given every shilling in my pocket to have been at that moment in
Margate.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Take it philosophically,&quot; said Devlin, at my elbow, &quot;and be
thankful that your bones are not broken. It will but prolong the hunt, which, I
promise you, shall in the end be successful.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I looked at him almost gratefully for this speculative crumb
of comfort, and there was real humour in the smile with which he met my gaze.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Behold me in another character,&quot; he said; &quot;Devlin the
Consoler. But you have laid me under an obligation, my dear sir, which I am
endeavouring to repay. Your conversation with that unhappy young man&quot;--pointing
to Carton, who stood at a little distance from us--&quot;was truly interesting. You
have mistaken your vocation; you would have made a first-class detective.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">To add to the discomfiture of the situation it began to rain
heavily. I felt it would be foolish, and a waste of power, to fret and fume, and
I therefore endeavoured to profit by Devlin's advice to take it philosophically.
A number of men were now at work setting things straight. They worked with a
will, but the guard's prognostication proved correct. It was nearly eleven
o'clock before we started again, and past midnight when we arrived at Margate.
It was pitch dark, and the furious wind drove the pelting rain into our faces.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A wild night at sea,&quot; cried Devlin, with a kind of exultation
in his voice (though this may have been my fancy); he had to speak very loud to
make himself heard. &quot;You can do nothing till the morning, and very little then
if the storm lasts. Do you know Margate at all?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; I shouted despondently.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you?&quot; asked Devlin, addressing Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've never been here before,&quot; replied Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's a decent hotel not far off,&quot; said Devlin: &quot;the
Nayland Rock. We'll knock them up, and get beds there. Cling tight to me if you
don't want your bones broken. Steady now, steady!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">We had to cling tightly to him, for we could not see a yard
before us. Devlin pulled us along, singing some strange wild song at the top of
his voice. We were a long time making those in the hotel hear us, but the door
was opened at last, and we were admitted. There was only one vacant room in the
hotel, but fortunately it contained two beds. To this room we were conducted,
and then came the question of settling three persons in the two beds. Devlin
solved the difficulty by pulling the counterpanes off, and extending himself
full length upon the floor.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This will do for me,&quot; he said, wrapping himself up in the
counterpanes. &quot;I've had worse accommodation in my travels through the world.
I've slept in the bush, with the sky for a roof; I've slept in the hollow of a
tree, with wild beasts howling round me; I've slept on billiard-tables and under
them, with a thousand rats running over me and a score of other wanderers.
Good-night, comrades.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Anxiety did not keep me awake; I was tired out, and slept
well. When we arose in the morning all signs of the storm had fled. The sun was
shining brightly, and a soft warm air flowed through the open window.</p>
<br>

<h5>ANOTHER STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">The first thing to be done, after partaking of a hurried
breakfast, was to arrange our programme. Carton suggested that we should all go
together to Athelstan Road to see his guardian, and I had some difficulty in
prevailing upon him to forego this plan. We spoke together quite openly in the
presence of Devlin, who, for the most part, contented himself with listening to
the discussion.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Evidently,&quot; said Carton, &quot;you have suspicions against my
guardian, and it is only fair that he should be made acquainted with them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He shall be made acquainted with them,&quot; I replied, &quot;but it
must be in the way and at the time I deem best. I hold you to your promise to be
guided by me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Carton nodded discontentedly. &quot;I am to stop here and do
nothing, I suppose,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is how you will best assist me,&quot; I said. &quot;If you are
seen at present by Mr. Dowsett, you will ruin everything. You shall not,
however, be quite idle. Have you your cheque-book with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, producing it.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let me look at the block of the cheque for the two thousand
pounds you drew on Saturday morning, payable to bearer, and gave to Mr.
Dowsett.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is the last cheque I drew,&quot; said Carton, handing me the
book.</p>

<p class="normal">I glanced at it, saw that the bank was the National Provincial
Bank of England, and the number of the cheque 134,178. Then I obtained a
telegraph form, and at my instruction Carton wrote the following telegram:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To the Manager, National Provincial Bank of England, 112
Bishopsgate Street, London. Has my cheque for two thousand pounds (No. 134,178),
drawn by me on Saturday, and made payable to bearer, been cashed, and how was it
paid, in notes or gold? Reply paid. Urgent. Waiting here for answer. From
Richard Carton, Nayland Rock Hotel, Margate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will take this myself to the telegraph-office,&quot; I said,
&quot;and you will wait here for the answer. I will be back as quickly as possible,
but it is likely I may be absent for an hour or more.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With that I left him, Devlin accompanying me at my request.</p>

<p class="normal">I could have sent the telegram from the railway station, but I
chose to send it from the local post-office, for the reason that I expected to
receive there a telegram from my wife, whom I had instructed to wire to me,
before eight o'clock, whether there was anything fresh in the London newspapers
concerning the murder of Lizzie Melladew. I mentioned this to Devlin, and he
said,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You omit nothing; it is a pleasure to work with you. Command
me in any way you please. My turn, perhaps, will come by and by.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was early morning, and our way lay along the Marine Parade,
every house in which was either a public or a boarding house. From every
basement in the row, as we walked on, ascended one uniform odour of the cooking
of bacon and eggs, which caused Devlin to humorously remark that when bacon and
eggs ceased to be the breakfast of the average Englishman, the decay of
England's greatness would commence. All along the line this familiar odour
accompanied us.</p>

<p class="normal">At the post-office I found my wife's telegram awaiting me. It
was to the effect that there was nothing new in the papers concerning the
murder. The criminal was still at large, and the police appeared to have failed
in obtaining a clue. I despatched Carton's telegram to the London bank, and then
we proceeded to Athelstan Road, and soon found the house we were in search of. I
had decided upon my plan of operations: Devlin was not to appear; he was to
stand at some distance from the house, and only to come forward if I called him.
I was to knock and inquire for Mr. Dowsett, and explain to him that, not feeling
well, I had run down to Margate for the day. Carton had given me his guardian's
address, and had asked me to inquire whether Mr. Dowsett would be absent from
London for any length of time, intending, if such was the case, to join Mr.
Dowsett and his family in the country. Then I was to trust to chance and to
anything I observed how next to proceed. The whole invention was as lame as well
could be, but I could not think of a better. It was only when decided action was
necessary that I felt how powerless I was. All that I had to depend upon was a
slender and mysterious thread of conjecture.</p>

<p class="normal">I knocked at the door, and of the servant who opened it I
inquired if Mr. Dowsett was up yet.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, yes, sir,&quot; replied the girl. &quot;Up and gone, all of 'em.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Up and gone, all of them!&quot; I exclaimed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, sir. Had breakfast at half-past six, and went away
directly afterwards.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know where to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, sir. O, here's missus.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The landlady came forward. &quot;Do you want rooms, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at present. I came to see Mr. Dowsett.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Gone away, sir; him and the three ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So your servant informed me; but I thought I should be
certain to find him here. Stop. What did you say? Mr. Dowsett and the three
ladies? You mean the two ladies?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I mean three,&quot; said the landlady, looking sharply at me.
&quot;They only came on Saturday; Mr. Dowsett came yesterday. You must excuse me,
sir; there's the dining-room bell and the drawing-room bell ringing all
together.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;A moment, I beg,&quot; I said, slipping half-a-crown into her
hand. &quot;Do you know where they have gone to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No; they didn't tell me. They were in a hurry to catch a
train; but I don't know what train, and don't know where to.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Her manner proclaimed that she not only did not know, but did
not care.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They had some boxes with them?&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, two. I can't wait another minute. I never did see such a
impatient gentleman as the dining-rooms.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only one more question,&quot; I said, forcibly detaining her. &quot;Did
they drive to the station?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes; they had a carriage. Please let me go, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know the man who drove them? Do you know the number of
the carriage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Haven't the slightest idea,&quot; said the landlady; and, freeing
herself from my grasp, she ran down to her kitchen.</p>

<p class="normal">I stepped into the street with a feeling of mortification. Mr.
Kenneth Dowsett had given me the slip again. Rejoining Devlin, I related to him
what had passed.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are you going to do next?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am puzzled,&quot; I replied, &quot;and hardly know what to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That is not like you,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;Come, I will assist you.
Mr. Kenneth Dowsett seems to be in a hurry. The more reason for spirit and
increased vigilance on our part. Observe, I say our part. I am growing
interested in this case, and am curious to see the end of it. If Mr. Dowsett has
gone back to London, we must follow him there. If he has gone to some other
place, we must follow him to some other place.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But how to find that out?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He was driven to the station in a carriage. We must get hold
of the driver. At present we are ignorant whether he has gone by the
South-Eastern or the London, Chatham, and Dover. We will go and inquire at the
cab-ranks.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">But although we spent fully an hour and a half in asking
questions of every driver of a carriage we saw, we could ascertain no news of
the carriage which had driven Mr. Dowsett and his family from Athelstan Road. I
was in despair, and was about to give up the search and return disconsolately to
the Nayland Rock, when a bare-footed boy ran up to me, and asked whether I
wasn't looking for &quot;the cove wot drove a party from Athelstan Road.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes,&quot; I said excitedly. &quot;Do you know him?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, I knows him,&quot; said the boy. &quot;Bill Foster he is. I 'elped
him up with the boxes. There was one little box the gent wouldn't let us touch.
There was somethink 'eavy in it, and the gent give me a copper. Thank yer, sir.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was about to scuttle off with the sixpence I gave him, when
I seized him, not by the collar, because he had none on, but by the neck where
the collar should have been.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not so fast. There's half-a-crown more for you if you take me
to Bill Foster at once.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can't do that, sir; don't know where he is; but I'll find 'im
for yer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Very good. How many persons went away in Bill Foster's
carriage?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There was the gent and one-two-three women--two young 'uns
and a old 'un.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You're quite sure?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I'll take my oath on it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Now look here? Do you see these five shillings? They're yours
if you bring Bill Foster to me at the Nayland Rock in less than half-an-hour.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You ain't kidding, sir?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not at all. The money's yours if you do what I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right, sir? I'll do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And tell Bill Foster there's half-a-sovereign waiting for him
at the Nayland Rock; but he mustn't lose a minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">With an intelligent nod the boy scampered off, and we made our
way quickly back to the hotel, where Richard Carton was impatiently waiting us.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did you see him?&quot; he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No,&quot; I replied, &quot;he went away early this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Where to?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I hope to learn that presently. Have you received an answer
to your telegram?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, not yet. There's the telegraph messenger.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The lad was mounting the steps of the hotel. We followed him,
and obtained the buff-coloured envelope, addressed to &quot;Richard Carton, Nayland
Rock Hotel, Margate,&quot; which he delivered to a waiter. Carton tore open the
envelope, read the message, and handed it to me. The information it contained
was that cheque 134,178, for two thousand pounds, signed by Richard Carton, was
cashed across the counter on Saturday morning; that the gentleman who presented
it demanded that it should be paid in gold; that as this was a large amount to
be so paid the cashier had asked the gentleman to sign his name at the back of
the cheque, notwithstanding that it was payable to bearer, and that the
signature was that of Kenneth Dowsett.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you think there is anything strange in that?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It does seem strange,&quot; replied Carton thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="normal">I made a rapid mental calculation, and said, &quot;Two thousand
sovereigns in gold weigh forty pounds. A heavy weight for a man to carry away
with him.&quot; Carton did not reply, but I saw that, for the first time, his
suspicions were aroused. &quot;You told me,&quot; I continued, &quot;that Mrs. Dowsett and her
daughter Letitia went away from their house on Saturday morning early.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;So my guardian informed me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Was any other lady stopping with them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I did not understand so from my guardian.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did they have any particular lady friend whom, for some
reason or other, they wished to take with them to the seaside?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not to my knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You can think of no one?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed, I cannot.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is your belief that only two ladies left the house?'</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, it is my belief.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But,&quot; I said, &quot;Mrs. Dowsett took not only her daughter
Letitia with her, but another lady, a young lady, as well; and the three, in
company with your guardian, left Margate suddenly this morning. I have
ascertained this positively. Now, who is this young lady of whom you have no
knowledge?&quot; He passed his hand across his forehead, and gazed at me with a
dawning terror in his eyes. &quot;Shall I tell you what is in my mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;If,&quot; I said, speaking slowly and impressively, &quot;the theory I
have formed is correct--and I believe it is--the young lady is Mary Melladew,
poor Lizzie's sister.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Carton. &quot;What makes you think that?&quot;</p>
<br>

<h5>WE TRACK MR. KENNETH DOWSETT TO BOULOGNE.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">&quot;It would occupy too long a time,&quot; I replied, &quot;to make my
theory thoroughly comprehensible to you. Besides,&quot; I added, glancing at Devlin,
&quot;it is a theory strangely born and strangely built up, and, in all likelihood,
you would reject the most important parts of it as incredible and impossible.
Therefore, we will not waste time in explaining or discussing it. Sufficient for
us if we succeed in tracing this dreadful mystery to its roots and in bringing
the murderer to justice. If I do not mistake, here comes the man I am waiting
for.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was, indeed. Bill Foster, pioneered by the sharp lad who
had engaged to find him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Here he is, sir,&quot; said the boy, holding out his hand,
half-eagerly, half-doubtfully.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Your name is Foster,&quot; I said, addressing the man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's me,&quot; said Bill Foster.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You drove a party from Athelstan Road early this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I counted five shillings into the boy's outstretched hand, and
he scampered away in great delight.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's half-a-sovereign for you,&quot; I said to Bill Foster, &quot;if
you answer correctly a few questions.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About the party I drove from Athelstan Road?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My questions will refer to them. You seem to hesitate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The fact is,&quot; said Bill Foster, &quot;the gentleman gave me a
florin over my fare to keep my mouth shut.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Only a fifth of what I offer you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Make it a sovereign,&quot; suggested Devlin.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I've no objection,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;All right,&quot; said Bill Foster; &quot;fire away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The gentleman bribed you to keep silence respecting his
movements?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It must have been for that,&quot; replied Bill Foster.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Proving,&quot; I observed, &quot;that he must have had some strong
reason for secrecy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That's got nothing to do with me,&quot; remarked Bill Foster.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Of course not. What you've got to do is to earn the
sovereign. Who engaged you for the job?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The gentleman himself. I wasn't out with my trap so early,
and some one must have told him where I live. Anyways, he comes at a
quarter-past six, and knocks me up, and says there's a good job waiting for me
at 28 Athelstan Road, if I'd come at once. I says, 'All right,' and I puts my
horse to, and drives there. I got to the house at ten minutes to seven, and I
drives the party to the London, Chatham, and Dover.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How many were in the party?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Four. The gentleman, a middle-aged lady, and two young 'uns.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;About what ages were the young ladies?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Can't quite say. They wore veils; but I should reckon from
eighteen to twenty-two. That's near enough.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What luggage was there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Two trunks, a small box, and some other little things they
took care of themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You had charge of the two trunks?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;And of the small box?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, no; the gentleman wouldn't let it out of his hands. I
offered to help him with it, but he wouldn't let me touch it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;That surprised you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Well, yes, because it was uncommon heavy. If it was filled
with gold he couldn't have been more careful of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps it was,&quot; I said, turning slightly to Richard Carton.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It was heavy enough. Why, he could hardly carry it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Did either of the ladies appear anxious about it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, the middle-aged one. When I saw them so particular, I
said, said I--to myself, you know--I shouldn't mind having that myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;When the gentleman told you to drive to the London, Chatham,
and Dover station, did he say what train he wished to catch?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No, but I found out the train they went by. It was the down
train for Ramsgate, 7.31.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;They reached the station some time before it started?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Yes, twenty minutes before. After the gentleman took his
tickets he came from the platform two or three times and looked at me. 'What are
you waiting for?' he asked the last time. 'For a fare,' I answered. 'Look here,'
he said, 'if anybody asks you any questions about me, don't answer them. 'Why
shouldn't I?' I asked. It was then he pulled out the florin. 'O, very well,' I
said; 'it's no business of mine.' But I didn't go away till the train started
with them in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know whether they intended to stop in Margate?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I should say not. As I drove 'em to the station, I heard the
gentleman speak to the middle-aged lady--his wife, I suppose--about the boat for
Boulogne.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I gave a start of vexation; Devlin smiled; Carton was
following the conversation with great attention.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know what boat?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The Sir Walter Raleigh. The gentleman had one of the bills in
his hand, and was looking at it. He said to the lady, 'We shall be in plenty of
time.'&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know at what time the boat starts from Ramsgate for
Boulogne?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Leaves the harbour at half-past nine, but is generally half
an hour late.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I looked at my watch. It was just eleven o'clock.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there any chance,&quot; I asked, &quot;of this boat being delayed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Why should it? The weather's fair.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Is there any other boat starting for Boulogne this morning?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;None. There's the Sir Walter Raleigh from Ramsgate, and
sometimes the India from here; but the India don't go to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Could we hire a boat from here?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You might, but it would be risky, and would cost a lot of
money. Then, there's no saying when you would get there. It's a matter of
between forty and fifty miles, and the steamers take about five hours getting
across; sometimes a little less, generally a little more. There's no depending
upon 'em. Look here. You're going to behave to me liberal. You want to follow
the party I drove from Athelstan Road this morning.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Show me the way to get to Boulogne to-day,&quot; I said, &quot;and I'll
give you another half-sovereign.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Practical creature!&quot; murmured Devlin. &quot;In human dealings
there is but one true touchstone.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Spoke like a real gentleman,&quot; said Bill Foster to me. &quot;What
time is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Five minutes past eleven.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Wait here; I sha'n't be gone but a few minutes. Get
everything ready to start directly I come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">His trap was standing at the corner of Royal Crescent. He ran
out, jumped on the box, and was gone. I called to the waiter, and in three
minutes the hotel bill was paid, and we were ready.</p>

<p class="normal">During Bill Foster's absence I said to Carton,</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you make anything of all this?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It looks,&quot; replied Carton, &quot;as if my guardian was running
away.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;To my mind there's not a doubt of it. Have you any idea what
that little box he would not let out of his charge contains?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The two thousand sovereigns he obtained from the bank,&quot; said
Carton, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Exactly. I tell you now plainly that I am positive Mr.
Kenneth Dowsett is implicated in the murder of your poor girl.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Carton set his teeth in great agitation. &quot;If he is! if he is!&quot;
he said; but he could say no more.</p>

<p class="normal">Bill Foster was back.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There's a train to Folkestone,&quot; he cried, &quot;the South-Eastern
line, at 11.47. You can catch it easily. If there's no boat handy from
Folkestone to Boulogne, you'll be able to hire one there. The steamers take two
hours going across. You can get there in four. Train arrives at Folkestone at
1.27. By six o'clock you can be in Boulogne. Jump into my trap, gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">We jumped in, and were driven to the station. His information
was correct. I gave him thirty shillings, and he departed in high glee. Then we
took tickets for Folkestone, and arrived there at a quarter to two.</p>

<p class="normal">There was no steamer going, but with little difficulty we
arranged to get across. The passage took longer than four hours--it took six. At
nine o'clock at night we were in Boulogne.</p>

<p class="normal">I cannot speak an intelligible sentence in French. Carton was
too agitated to take the direction of affairs.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do you know where we can stop?&quot; I asked of Devlin. &quot;Have you
ever been here before?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;I have travelled all over the
world, and I know Boulogne by heart. There's a little out-of-the-way hotel, the
Htel de Poilly, in Rue de l'Amiral Bruix, that will suit us as though it were
built for us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Let us get there at once,&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">He called a fly, and in a very short time we entered the
courtyard of the Hotel de Poilly. There we made arrangements with the jolly,
comfortable-looking landlady, and then I looked at Carton, and he looked at me.
The helplessness of our situation struck us both forcibly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Who is in command?&quot; asked Devlin suddenly.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You,&quot; I replied, as by an inspiration.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Good,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;I accept the office. From this moment
you are under my orders. Remain you here; I go to reconnoitre.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You will return?&quot; I said.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My dear sir,&quot; said Devlin airily, &quot;it is too late now to
doubt my integrity. I will return.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;For God's sake,&quot; said Carton, when Devlin was gone, &quot;who is
this man who seems to divine everything, to know everything, and whom nothing
disturbs? Sometimes when he looks at me I feel that he is exercising over me a
terrible fascination.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot answer you,&quot; I said. &quot;Be satisfied with the
knowledge that it is through him we have so far succeeded, and that, in my
belief, it will be through him that the murderer will be tracked down. The world
is full of mysteries, and that man is not the least of them.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It wanted an hour to midnight when Devlin returned. In his
inscrutable face I read no sign of success or failure; but the first words he
spoke afforded me infinite relief.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I have seen him,&quot; he said. &quot;Let us go out and talk. Walls
have ears.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">The river Liane was but a short distance from the hotel, and
we strolled along the bank in silence, Devlin, contrary to my expectation, not
uttering a word for many minutes. He had lit a cigar, and Carton had accepted
one from him; I refused to smoke, having too vivid a remembrance of the cigar I
had smoked in Fanny Lemon's house, and its effect upon me. At length Devlin said
to Carton:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You appear sleepy.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I am,&quot; said the young man.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You had best go to bed,&quot; said Devlin; &quot;nothing can be done
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Carton, assenting, would have returned to the hotel alone,
saying he could find the way, but I insisted that we should accompany him
thither. I had heard that Boulogne was not the safest place in the world for
strangers on a dark night. Having seen Carton to his room, we returned to the
river's bank. Had Carton been in possession of his full senses he would
doubtless have objected, but he was dead asleep when he entered his bedroom,
Devlin's cigar having affected him as the one I smoked had affected me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;He encumbers us,&quot; said Devlin, looking out upon the dark
river. &quot;I have discovered where Mr. Dowsett is lodging, and were our young
friend informed of the address he might rush there, and spoil all. We happen to
be in luck, if you believe in such a quality as luck. I do not; but I use the
term out of compliment to you. Mr. Dowsett's quarters are in the locality of the
Rue de la Paix, and, singularly enough, are situated over a barber's shop.
Things go in runs, do they not? Nothing but barbers. I do not return with you to
the hotel to-night.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked, startled by this information.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The proprietor of the barber's shop over which Mr. Kenneth
Dowsett is sleeping--but, perhaps, not sleeping, for a sword is hanging above
his head, and he may be gazing at the phantom in terror--say, then, over which
he is lying, is an agreeable person. I have struck up an acquaintance with him,
and, by arrangement, shall be in his saloon to-morrow, to attend to any persons
who may present themselves. Mr. Dowsett will probably need the razor and the
brush. I can easily account for my appearance in Boulogne; I have come to see my
friend and brother. Mr. Dowsett, unsuspecting--for what connection can he trace
between me and Lizzie Melladew?--will place himself in my hands. He has told me
that there is not my equal; he may find that it is so. In order that I may not
miss him I go to the house to-night. Early in the morning come you, alone, to
the Rue de la Paix. You can ride to the foot of the hill, there alight, and on
the right-hand side, a third of the way up, you will see my new friend's
establishment. I will find you a snug corner from which you may observe and
hear, yourself unseen, all that passes. Are you satisfied now that I am keeping
faith with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Indeed, you are proving it,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Give me no more credit than I deserve,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;It is
simply that I keep a promise. In the fulfilment of this promise--both in the
spirit and to the letter, my dear sir--I may to-morrow unfold to you a wonder.
It is my purpose to compel the man we have pursued to himself reveal all that he
knows of Lizzie Melladew. Perhaps it will be as well for you to take down in
writing what passes between us. Accept it from me that there are unseen forces
and unseen powers in this world, so rich in sin, of which few men dream. See
those shadows moving on the water--are they not like living spirits? The dark
river itself, had it a tongue, could appal you. On such nights as this are
secret crimes committed by devils who bear the shape of men. What kind of being
is that who smiles in your face, who presses your hand, who speaks pleasant
words to you, and harbours all the while in what is called his heart a fell
design towards the execution of which he moves without one spark of compassion?
I don't complain of him, my dear sir; on the contrary&quot;--and here, although I
could not see Devlin's face, I could fancy a sinister smile overspreading it--&quot;I
rather delight in him. It proves him to be what he is--and he is but a type of
innumerable others. Your innocent ones are arrogant in the vaunting of their
goodness; your ambitious ones glory in their successes which bring ruin to their
brethren; your kings and emperors appropriate Providence, and do not even pay
him a shilling for the conscription. A grand world, and grandly peopled! The man
who glories in sin compels my admiration; but this one whom we are hunting is a
coward and a sneak. He shall meet his doom!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As he ceased speaking he vanished; I can find no other word to
express the effect his sudden disappearance had upon me. Whether he intended to
create a dramatic surprise I cannot say, but, certainly, he was no longer by my
side. With some difficulty I found my way alone back to the Hotel de Poilly,
where Carton was fast asleep.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><a name="div1_28" href="#div1Ref_28">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a></h4>

<h5>THE TRANCE AND THE REVELATION.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">Of all the strange experiences I have narrated in connection
with Devlin, that which awaited me on the following morning was the most
startling and inexplicable. Prevailing with difficulty upon Richard Carton to
remain at the hotel until I either came to or sent for him, I drove to the foot
of the Rue de la Paix, as I was instructed to do. I took the precaution to hire
the driver of the fly by the hour, and desired him to stop where I alighted
until I needed him. I was impelled to this course by a feeling that I might
possibly require some person to take a message to Carton or bring him to the Rue
de la Paix. I found the barber's shop easily, and could scarcely refrain from
uttering a loud exclamation at the sight of Mr. Kenneth Dowsett sitting in a
barber's chair, and Devlin standing over him, leisurely at work. Devlin, with
his finger at his lips, pointed to a table in a corner of the shop, at which I
seated myself in obedience to the silent command. On the table were writing
materials and paper, and on a sheet of this paper was written: &quot;You are late. I
have thrown Mr. Dowsett into a trance. He will reveal all he knows. I will
compel him to do so. Take down in writing what transpires.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">My heart throbbed violently as I prepared myself for the task.</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Do you know where you are?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;Yes, in Boulogne.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Where were you yesterday?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;In Margate.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Where were you on Friday last?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;At home, in London.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Recall the occurrences of that day?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I do so.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;At what hour did you rise?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;At nine o'clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Who were present at the breakfast-table?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;My wife and daughter, and Richard Carton.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Was anything relating to the engagement of Richard
Carton and Lizzie Melladew said at the breakfast-table?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Was there anything in your mind in relation to it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;Yes. I had a plan to carry out, and was thinking
of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;In what way did you put the plan into execution?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;When breakfast was over, I went to my private
room and locked the door. Then I sat down and wrote a letter.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;To whom?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;To Lizzie Melladew.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What did you write?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;A heart-broken woman implores you to meet her
to-night at eleven o'clock in Victoria Park, and, so that she may recognise you,
begs you to wear a bunch of white daisies in your belt. She will wear the same,
so that you may recognise her. The life and welfare of Mr. Richard Carton hangs
upon this meeting. If you fail, a dreadful fate awaits him, which you can avert.
As you value his happiness and your own, come.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What did you do with the letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I addressed it to Miss Lizzie Melladew, at her
place of business in Baker Street, and posted it at the Charing Cross
Post-office.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;How did you know she worked there?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I learnt it from my ward, Richard Carton.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did you disguise your handwriting?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;Yes; I wrote it in a feminine hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What was your object in writing the letter?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I was determined that Richard Carton should not
marry Lizzie Melladew.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I had all along arranged that he should marry my
daughter Letitia.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;How did you propose to break off the match between
your ward and Lizzie Melladew?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;My plans were not entirely clear to myself. I
intended to appeal to the young woman, and to invent some disreputable story to
make her suspect that he was false to her. If that failed, then----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Proceed. Then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I was resolved to go any lengths, to do anything
to prevent the marriage.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Even murder.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I did not think of that--I would not think of
it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;But you did think of it. You could not banish that
idea from your mind?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I could not, though I tried. It crept in the
whole of the day. I could not help seeing the scene. Night--the park--the young
woman with the bunch of white daisies in her belt stained with blood.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Those pictures were in your mind, and you could not
banish them?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I could not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;There were other reasons for preventing the marriage
than your wish that Richard Carton should marry your daughter?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;There were.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What were they?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;If he married Lizzie Melladew, I should no
longer enjoy the income I had received for so many years. I looked upon it as
mine. I could not live without it. We should have been beggared--disgraced as
well. I had forged my ward's name to bills, and if he married out of my family
there would have been exposure, and I might have found myself in a felon's dock.
If he married my daughter this would not occur. I was safe so long as I could
keep my hold upon him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did your wife and daughter know this?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;My daughter knew nothing of it. My wife
suspected it.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did she know that you contemplated murder?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;She did not.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Why did you give Richard Carton a sleeping draught on
that night?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;In order that he might sleep soundly, and not
discover that I left the house late.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Were your wife and daughter asleep when you left your
house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;They were abed. I do not know whether they were
asleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;You took a knife with you?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Where did you obtain it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;It was a large clasp knife I had had for years.
I found it in a private drawer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;You went to the private drawer for the purpose of
finding it?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I did.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did any one see you leave the house?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;No one.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did you walk or ride to Victoria Park?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I walked.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;To avoid suspicion?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;When you arrived at the Park did you have any
difficulty in finding Miss Melladew?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I soon found her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What did you do then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I made an appeal to her.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Did she listen to you quietly?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;No. She taunted me with having tricked her by
writing an anonymous letter in a disguised hand.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;Go on.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I told her it was the only way I could obtain a
private interview with her. I invented a scandalous story about my ward. She
said she did not believe it, and that she would expose me to him. She told me
that I was infamous, and that it was her belief I had been systematically
practising deceit upon my ward, and that she would not be surprised to discover
that I had been robbing him. 'To-morrow he shall see you in your true colours,'
she said. I was maddened. If she carried out her intention I knew that I was a
ruined and disgraced man. 'That to-morrow will never come!' I cried. The knife
was in my hand. I scarcely know how it came there, and do not remember opening
the blade. 'That to-morrow will come!' she retorted. 'It shall not!' I cried;
and I stabbed her to the heart. She uttered but one cry, and fell down dead.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;What did you do after that?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I hastened away, taking the knife with me. I
chose the darkest paths. Suddenly I came upon a young woman sitting upon a
bench, reclining against the back. I saw her face, and was rooted to the spot in
sudden fear. She did not stir. Recovering, I crept softly towards her, and found
that she was asleep. Leaving her there, I hastened back to the woman I had
stabbed. I knelt down and looked closely at her. I felt in her pockets; she was
quite dead. There were letters in her pockets which I examined, and then--and
then----&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin: &quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mr. Dowsett: &quot;I discovered that the woman I had killed was not
Lizzie Melladew!&quot;</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h5>THE RESCUE.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">So startled was I by this revelation that I jumped to my feet
in a state of uncontrollable agitation. What I should have done I cannot say,
but the direction of events was not left in my hands. Simultaneously with my
movement of astonishment, a piercing scream rang through the house.</p>

<p class="normal">I was standing now by the chair in which Mr. Kenneth Dowsett
was sitting in his trance, and I observed a change pass over his face; the
scream had pierced the veil in which his waking senses were enshrouded. Devlin
also observed this change, and he said to me hurriedly:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Go up-stairs and see what is taking place. Your presence may
be needed there, and to one person may be very welcome. I will keep charge over
this man.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">As I left the room I heard Devlin turn the key in the lock.
Rapidly I mounted the stairs, and dashed into a room on the first landing, from
which the sound of female voices were issuing. Three women were there; two were
strangers to me, but even in that agitating moment I correctly divined that they
were Mrs. Dowsett and Letitia; the third, who rushed with convulsive sobs into
my open arms, was no other than Lizzie Melladew herself.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;O, thank God, you have come!&quot; she sobbed; &quot;thank God! thank
God! Where is Mary? Where is Richard? Take me to them! O, take me to them!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Mrs. Dowsett was the first to recover herself. &quot;You will
remain here,&quot; she said sternly to Lizzie; and then, addressing me, &quot;How dare you
break into my apartment in this manner?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I dare do more than that,&quot; I replied, in a voice sterner than
her own, and holding the weeping girl close to my heart. &quot;Prepare you to answer
for what has been done. I thank God, indeed, that I have arrived in time,
perhaps, to prevent another crime. All is discovered.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">At these words Mrs. Dowsett shrank back, white and trembling.
I did not stop to say more. My first duty was to place Lizzie Melladew in
safety; but where? The mental question conveyed its own answer. Where, but in
her lover's arms?</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Come,&quot; I said to Lizzie. &quot;You are safe now. I am going to
take you to Richard Carton. Trust yourself to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I will, I will!&quot; sobbed Lizzie, &quot;Richard is here, then? How
thankful I am, how thankful! And Mary, my dear sister, is she here, too?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I was appalled at this last question. It proved that Lizzie
was ignorant of what had occurred. Not daring to answer her, I drew her from the
room, and the women I left there made no attempt to prevent me. Swiftly I took
my precious charge from the house, and in a very few minutes we were in the
carriage which was waiting for me at the foot of the Rue de la Paix. The driver
understood the direction I gave him, and we galloped at full speed to the Hotel
de Poilly. Without revealing to Lizzie what I knew, I learnt from her before we
reached the hotel sufficient to enlighten me as to Mr. Kenneth Dowsett's
proceedings, and to confirm my suspicion that it was Mary Melladew who had met
her death at that villain's hands. When Lizzie received the anonymous letter
which he wrote to her, she took it to her poor sister, who, fearing some plot,
prevailed upon her to let her see the anonymous writer in Lizzie's place; and,
the better to carry out the plan, the sisters changed dresses, and went together
to Victoria Park. Being twins, and bearing so close a resemblance to each other,
there was little fear of the change being discovered until at least Mary had
ascertained why the meeting was so urgently desired. Leaving Lizzie in a
secluded part of the park, Mary proceeded to the rendezvous, with what result
Mr. Dowsett's confession has already made clear. Discovering the fatal error he
had committed, Mr. Dowsett returned to Lizzie, who, while waiting for her
sister, had fallen asleep. Being thoroughly unnerved, he decided that there was
only one means of safety before him--flight and the concealment of Lizzie
Melladew. The idea of a second murder may have occurred to him, but, villain as
he was, he had not the courage to carry it out. He had taken from the dead
girl's pocket everything it contained, with the exception of a handkerchief
which, in his haste, he overlooked; and upon this handkerchief was marked the
name of Lizzie Melladew. He could imitate Richard Carton's writing--as was
proved by the forgeries he had already committed--and upon the back of this
anonymous letter he wrote in pencil a few words in which Lizzie was implored to
trust herself implicitly to Mr. Dowsett, and without question to do as he
directed. Signing these words in Richard Carton's name, he awoke Lizzie and gave
her the note. Alarmed and agitated as the young girl was, and fearing that some
great danger threatened her lover, she, with very little hesitation, allowed
herself to be persuaded by Mr. Dowsett, and accompanied him home. &quot;Where is
Mary?&quot; she asked. &quot;With our dear Richard,&quot; replied Mr. Dowsett; &quot;we shall see
them to-morrow, when all will be explained.&quot; At home Mr. Dowsett informed his
wife of his peril, and the three females left for Margate by an early train in
the morning. In Margate Mrs. Dowsett received telegrams signed &quot;Richard Carton,&quot;
but really sent by her husband, which she showed to Lizzie, and which served in
some measure to assist the successful continuation of the scheme by which Lizzie
was to be taken out of the country. Meanwhile she was in absolute ignorance of
her sister's fate; no newspaper was allowed to reach her hands, nor was she
allowed to speak to a soul but Mrs. Dowsett and Letitia. What was eventually to
be done with her I cannot say; probably Mr. Dowsett himself had not been able to
make up his mind, which was almost entirely occupied by considerations for his
own safety.</p>

<p class="normal">I did not, of course, learn all this from Lizzie, she being
then ignorant of much which I have related, but I have put together what she
told me and what I subsequently learnt from Devlin and other sources.</p>

<p class="normal">Arriving at the Hotel de Poilly, I succeeded in conveying
Lizzie into a private room, and then I sought Richard Carton. I need not set
down here in detail the conversation I had with him. Little by little I made him
acquainted with the whole truth. Needless to describe his joy when he heard that
his beloved girl was alive and safe--joy, tempered with grief at poor Mary's
fate. When he was calm enough to be practical, he asked me what was to be done.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No time must be lost,&quot; I said, &quot;in restoring your dear Lizzie
to her parents. To you I shall confide her. Leave that monster, your treacherous
guardian, to Devlin and me.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was with difficulty I restrained him from rushing to
Lizzie, but I insisted that his movements must be definitely decided upon before
he saw her. I called in the assistance of the jolly landlady, and she supplied
me with a time-table, from which I ascertained that a boat for Dover left at
12.31, and that it was timed to reach its destination at 3.20. There were
numerous trains from Dover to London, and Lizzie would be in her parents' arms
before night. Carton joyfully acquiesced in this arrangement, and then I took
him in to his dear girl, and, closing the door upon them, left them to
themselves. A meeting such as theirs, and under such circumstances, was sacred.</p>

<p class="normal">While they were together I wrote two letters--one to my wife,
and the other to Mr. Portland--which I intended should be delivered by Carton. I
did not intrude upon the happy lovers till the last moment. I found them sitting
close together, quite silent, hand clasped in hand, her head upon his breast. I
had cautioned him to say nothing of Mary's sad fate, and I saw by the expression
upon Lizzie's face that he had obeyed me. After joy would come sorrow; there was
time enough for that. Mary had given her life for her sister's; the sacrifice
would ever be held in sacred remembrance.</p>

<p class="normal">I saw them off by the boat; they waved their handkerchiefs to
me, and I thought of the Melladews mourning at home, to whom, at least, one dear
child would soon be restored. When the boat was out of sight, I jumped into the
carriage, and was driven back to the Rue de la Paix.</p>

<h5>DEVLIN'S LAST SCHEME.</h5>
<br>

<p class="normal">I tried the door of the room in which I had left Devlin and
Mr. Kenneth Dowsett. It was locked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Enter,&quot; said Devlin, unlocking the door.</p>

<p class="normal">They were both in the room, Devlin smiling and unruffled, Mr.
Dowsett in the full possession of his senses, and terribly ill at ease.</p>

<p class="normal">He turned like death when he saw me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;This gentleman,&quot; said Devlin, &quot;is angry at being detained by
me, and would have resorted to violence if he thought it would serve his
purpose. I have waited for your return to decide what to do.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall pay for this,&quot; Mr. Dowsett managed to say, &quot;you and
your confederate. If there is justice in this world, I will make you smart for
your unlawful proceedings.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There <i>is</i> justice in the world,&quot; I said calmly, &quot;as you
shall find.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He was silent. With a weight of guilt upon his soul, he did
not know how to reply to this remark. But he managed presently to ask:</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;How long do you intend to detain me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You shall know soon,&quot; I said; and, by a gesture, I intimated
to Devlin that I wished to confer with him alone.</p>

<p class="normal">He accompanied me from the room, and we stood in the passage,
keeping guard upon the door, which Devlin locked from the outside.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There are no means of escape from within,&quot; he said. &quot;I have
seen to that.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">In a low tone I told him what I had done, and he approved.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;The question now is,&quot; I said, &quot;what step are we next to
take?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;There lies the difficulty,&quot; replied Devlin. &quot;You see my dear
sir, we have no evidence upon which to arrest him.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;No evidence!&quot; I cried. &quot;Is there not his own confession of
guilt?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Devlin shook his head. &quot;Spiritual evidence only, my dear sir.
Not admissible in any court of law in the world. Impossible to obtain his arrest
in a foreign country upon such a slender thread. He might bring the same
accusation against us, and we might all be thrown into gaol, and kept there for
months. That is not what I bargained for. Our best plan will be to get him back
to England; then you can take some practicable step.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;But how to manage that?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It can be managed, I think,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;I have a scheme.
He knows nothing of the confession he has made. Lizzie Melladew's name has not
been mentioned between us. It is only his fears and my strength of will that
make him tractable. Before I put my scheme into operation, go up-stairs to see
if his wife and daughter are in the house. I have my suspicions that they have
flown. You will find me here when you come down.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">I ran up-stairs to the apartments occupied by Mrs. Dowsett.
Devlin's suspicions were confirmed. The two women were gone. There were
evidences around of a hasty flight, the most pregnant of them being a small box
which had been broken open. I judged immediately that this was the box which had
contained the two thousand sovereigns; and, indeed, I found two of the
sovereigns under a couch, whither they had rolled while the bulk was being taken
out. The conclusion I came to was, that the women, frightened that all was
discovered, as I had informed them, had broken open the box, and, packing the
gold away upon their persons, had taken to flight, leaving Mr. Dowsett to his
fate.</p>

<p class="normal">I went down to Devlin, and acquainted him with the result of
my investigation.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Quite as I expected,&quot; he said. &quot;Let them go for the present.
Our concern is with the man inside. I am going to put my scheme into operation.
What is the time?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Five minutes past two,&quot; I replied, looking at my watch.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;In capital time,&quot; said Devlin. &quot;Wait you here until half-past
two. Then go in to Mr. Dowsett, and apologise to him for the indignity to which
he has been subjected. He will fume and threaten; let him. Be you humble and
contrite, and say that you are very, very sorry. Throw all the blame upon me:
say that I have deceived you, imposed upon you, robbed you--anything that comes
to your mind. To me it matters not; it will assist our scheme. There is no fear
of Mr. Dowsett not waiting till you go in to him; he is frightened out of his
life. Your humble attitude will give him courage; he will think himself safe.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I cannot imagine,&quot; I said, &quot;how this will help us.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Don't imagine,&quot; said Devlin curtly. &quot;Leave all to me. The
first thing Mr. Dowsett will do when he finds himself free will be to go up to
the rooms in which he left the three women who accompanied him here. Meanwhile,
you will keep watch outside the house; but on no account must he see you. Trust
to me for the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He had served me so faithfully up to this point that I trusted
him unhesitatingly. As he had prophesied, Mr. Dowsett kept quiet within the
room. Listening at the door, I heard him moving softly about, but he made no
attempt to come out. At half-past two I entered the room, and followed Devlin's
instructions to the letter. Mr. Dowsett, his courage restored, immediately began
to bluster and threaten. I listened submissively, and made pretence of being
greatly distressed. When he had exhausted himself, I left him with further
profuse expressions of regret, and as I issued from the house I saw him mounting
the stairs to his wife's apartments.</p>

<p class="normal">Emerging into the Rue de la Paix, I planted myself in a spot
from which I had a clear view of the house, and was myself concealed from
observation. Scarcely was I settled in my position when I saw a man, with a
telegram in his hand, enter the house. He remained there a very few moments, and
then came out and walked away, having, presumably, delivered his message. Within
a space of five minutes, Mr. Dowsett, holding the telegram, came forth, and,
casting sharp glances around, quickly left the Rue de la Paix. Before he had
turned the corner, Devlin joined me, humming a French song. Together we followed
Mr. Dowsett at a safe distance.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;My scheme is alive,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="normal">I asked him to explain it to me.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You saw the messenger,&quot; he said, &quot;enter with a telegram. You
saw him leave without it. You saw Mr. Dowsett come out with the telegram. It was
from his wife.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;From his wife?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Sent by me. The telegram was to the effect that something had
occurred which had induced her to leave Boulogne immediately, and that she, her
daughter, and the young lady with them (I was careful not to mention her name,
you see) would be in Ramsgate, waiting for him. He was to come by the afternoon
boat, and she would meet him on the pier. See, he is entering the
shipping-office now, to secure his passage.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What are we to do?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;We travel in the same boat, going aboard at the last moment.
After the boat has started--not before--he will know that we are
fellow-passengers.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">All happened as Devlin had arranged. By his skilful pioneering
we did not lose sight of Mr. Dowsett until he stepped aboard the boat, and I
inferred from his manner that by that time he had regained confidence, and
deemed his secret safe. When we slipped on deck, at the very moment of starting,
Mr. Dowsett was below in the saloon.</p>

<p class="normal">There were not many passengers, and the French coast was still
in view when Mr. Dowsett came up from the saloon and stood by the bulwarks,
within a yard or two of the seat upon which we were sitting. We did not speak,
but sat watching him. Turning, he saw us.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;You here!&quot; he cried.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;By your leave,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Not by my leave,&quot; he said. &quot;Why are you following me?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Have you any reason,&quot; I said, &quot;for suspecting that you are
being followed?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;I was a fool to ask the question,&quot; he said, turning abruptly
away.</p>

<p class="normal">I did not speak, but kept my eyes upon him. I was determined
not to lose sight of him for another moment. Some understanding of this
determination seemed to dawn upon him; he looked at me two or three times with
wavering eyes, and presently, summoning all his courage to his aid, he stared me
full in the face. I met his gaze sternly, unflinchingly, until I compelled him
to lower his eyes. Then he suddenly went down into the saloon. I stepped swiftly
after him, and Devlin accompanied me. For the purpose of testing me, he turned
and ascended again to the deck. We followed him.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; he said, &quot;you will explain what you mean by this
conduct?&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;What need to ask?&quot; I replied. &quot;Let your conscience answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;It is an outrage,&quot; he said, after a pause. &quot;If you continue
to annoy me, I shall appeal to the captain.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Do so,&quot; I said, &quot;and prepare to meet at once the charge I
shall bring against you.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">He did not dare to inquire the nature of the charge. He did
not dare to move or speak again. Sullenly, and with an inward raging, the traces
of which he could not disguise, he remained by the bulwarks, staring down at the
water.</p>

<p class="normal">Suddenly there was a lull aboard. The machinery stopped
working.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Some accident,&quot; said Devlin, and went to ascertain its
nature. Returning, he said, &quot;We shall be delayed a couple of hours, most likely.
It will be dark night, when we arrive.&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">It was as he said. For two hours or more we made no progress;
then, the necessary repairs having been made, we started again. By that time it
was evening. And still Mr. Dowsett neither moved or spoke.</p>

<p class="normal">Night crept on; there was no moon, and not a star visible in
the dark sky; it was black night. Mr. Dowsett strove to take advantage of this
to evade and escape from us, but we kept so close to him that we could have
touched him by the movement of a finger; where he glided, we glided; and still
he uttered not a word.</p>

<p class="normal">We stood in a group alone, isolated as it were, from the other
passengers. After repeated attempts to slip from us, Mr. Dowsett remained still
again. In the midst of the darkness Devlin's voice stole upon our ears.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Short-sighted fool,&quot; he said, &quot;to think that crime can be for
ever successfully hidden. Wherever man moves, the spirit of committed evil
accompanies him, and leads him to his doom. His peril lies not only in mortal
insight, but in the unseen, mysterious agencies, by which he is surrounded.
Blood for blood; it is the immutable law; and if by some human failure he for a
time evades his punishment at the hand of man, he suffers a punishment more
terrible than human justice can execute upon him. Waking or sleeping, it is ever
with him. Look out upon the darkness, and behold, rising from the shadows, the
form of the innocent girl whose life you took. To the last moment of your life
her spirit shall accompany you; till death claims you, you shall know no peace!&quot;</p>

<p class="normal">Whatever of malignancy there was in Devlin's voice, the words
he spoke conveyed the stern, eternal truth. It seemed to me, as I gazed before
me, that the spirit he evoked loomed sadly among the shadows.</p>

<p class="normal">Onward through the sea the boat ploughed its way, and we three
stood close together, encompassed by a dread and awful silence; for Devlin spoke
no more, nor from Mr. Dowsett's lips did any sound issue.</p>

<p class="normal">In the distance we saw the lights of Ramsgate Pier, and before
the captain or any person on board was aware of its close contiguity, we
suddenly dashed against it.</p>

<p class="normal">I and all others on board were thrown violently down by the
shock. There were loud cries of alarm and agony, and I found myself separated
from my companions. From the water came appeals for help from some who had been
tossed overboard by the collision, and a period of great confusion ensued. What
help could be given was afforded, and when I succeeded in reaching the stone
pier in safety, I heard that a few of the passengers were missing--among them
Devlin and Mr. Dowsett.</p>

<p class="normal">I remained on the pier till past one o'clock in the morning,
rendering what little assistance I could; and eventually I learnt that all who
had been in danger were saved, with the exception of the two whom I have named.
It was early morning before the body of one was recovered. That one was Mr.
Kenneth Dowsett. He lay dead in a boat, his face convulsed with agony, upturned
to the gray light of the coming day. Of Devlin no trace could be found.</p>

<br>
<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">There is but little more to tell. With the exception of the
part which Devlin played in it, and which has now for the first time been
related, the story became public property, and Kenneth Dowsett was proved to be
the murderer of poor Mary Melladew. Time has softened the grief of Mr. and Mrs.
Melladew, and they find in the love of Lizzie and her husband, Richard Carton,
some solace for the tragedy which a ruthless hand committed. Mr. Portland paid
me the two thousand pounds he promised, and I am in a fair way of business.
Fanny Lemon and her husband live in retirement in the country. Not a word ever
passes their lips in connection with the events I have related. I have seen and
heard nothing of Mrs. Dowsett and her daughter.</p>

<br>
<p class="center" style="letter-spacing:25px">* * * * * *</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">A short time ago my wife and I were in an open-air public
place of amusement witnessing a wonderful exhibition, the extraordinary novelty
of which consisted in a man floating earthwards from the clouds at a distance of
some thousands of feet from the earth.</p>

<p class="normal">&quot;Look there!&quot; said my wife.</p>

<p class="normal">I had given her such faithful and vivid descriptions of Devlin
that she always said, if it happened that he still lived and she saw him, that
she could not fail to recognise him. I turned in the direction she indicated,
and, standing alone, apart from the crowd, once more saw Devlin. He was watching
the performer floating from heaven to earth. There was a strange smile upon his
lips.</p>

<p class="normal">I could not restrain the impulse which prompted me to move
towards him. My approach attracted his attention. He looked at me, and was gone.
I have never seen him since.</p>

<p class="normal">The last words I heard him speak recur to me. There was in
them the spirit of Divine justice. Crimes cannot be for ever successfully
hidden. The monsters who commit them shall be brought to their doom by those
whose duty it is to track them down, or by unseen mysterious agencies by which
they are surrounded, or by their own confession.</p>

<p class="normal">But let the legislators see to it; let those who call
themselves philanthropists and humanitarians see to it; let those whose fortune
it is to possess great wealth see to it. There are in this modern Babylon
fester-spots of corruption wherein nothing but sin and vice can possibly grow.
They are crowded with human beings ripening for evil; they are crowded with
human souls lost to salvation. They are an infamy--and the infamy rests not upon
the creatures who are born and bred there, but upon those who allow them to be,
and who have the undoubted power to cleanse them, and make them healthy for body
and soul. For generation upon generation have they been allowed to breed
corruption; to this day they are allowed to do so. All who have the remedy in
their hands are responsible. The preacher who preaches and does not practise;
the rich who can afford, but grudges to give; the statesman with his dilettante
efforts towards social improvement, and his huge efforts towards place and
power--one and all of these are accountable for the sin. It is no less, and it
rests upon them.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
